( “ RJF , ” the “ firm ” or the “ Company ” ) is a leading diversified financial services company providing private client group , capital markets , asset management , banking and other services to individuals , corporations and municipalities . The firm , together with its subsidiaries , is engaged in various financial services activities , including providing investment management services to retail and institutional clients , the underwriting , distribution , trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities , and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products . The firm also provides corporate and retail banking services , and trust services . We operate predominately in the United States ( “ U.S. ” ) and , to a lesser extent , in Canada , the United Kingdom ( “ U.K. ” ) , and other parts of Europe.Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) under the symbol “ RJF. ” As a bank holding company and financial holding company , RJF is subject to supervision , examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) .Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , associates , and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through five segments . Our business segments are Private Client Group ( “ PCG ” ) , Capital Markets , Asset Management and Raymond James Bank ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . Our Other segment includes our private equity investments , interest income on certain corporate cash balances , and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to our business segments , including the interest costs on our public debt.The following graph depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our business segments for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2020 . * The preceding chart does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.Private Client GroupWe provide financial planning , investment advisory and securities transaction services through a branch office network . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice . Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting , transitional cost assistance , and retention purposes.3RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESTotal client assets under administration ( “ AUA ” ) in our PCG segment as of September 30 , 2020 were $ 883.3 billion , of which $ 475.3 billion related to fee-based accounts ( “ fee-based AUA ” ) . We had 8,239 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2020.Employee financial advisorsEmployee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to retail clients . Compensation for these financial advisors primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans.Independent contractor financial advisorsOur financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , receive a higher payout percentage on the revenues they generate than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , and on a limited basis , they are permitted to conduct certain other approved business activities , such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services.Products and servicesIrrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investment products and services , including both third-party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues from this segment are typically driven by AUA and are generally either asset-based or transactional in nature . The proportion of our brokerage revenues originating from the employee versus independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced.PCG segment net revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2020 are presented in the following graph . * Included in “ Brokerage revenues ” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.We provide the following products and services through this segment : •Investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules.•Portfolio management services for which we charge either a fee computed as a percentage of the assets in the client ’ s account or a flat periodic fee.•Insurance and annuity products.•Professionally managed mutual funds.4RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES•Support to third-party product partners , including sales and marketing support , product availability and distribution , and accounting and administrative services.•Administrative services to banks to which we sweep a portion of our clients ’ cash deposits as part of the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , our multi-bank sweep program . Fees received from third-party banks for these services are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program , as well as the level of short-term interest rates relative to interest paid to clients by the third-party banks on balances in the RJBDP . PCG also earns servicing fees from RJ Bank , which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to RJ Bank . These fees are eliminated in consolidation.•Margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed based on current interest rates.•Custodial services , trading , research and other support and services ( including access to clients ’ account information and the services of the Asset Management segment ) to the independent registered investment advisors who are affiliated with us.•Securities borrowing and lending activities with other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties . The net revenues of this business generally consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities.•Diversification strategies and alternative investment products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors.Capital MarketsOur Capital Markets segment conducts institutional sales , securities trading , equity research , investment banking and the syndication and management of investments that qualify for tax credits ( referred to as our “ tax credit funds ” business ) . Capital Markets segment net revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2020 are presented in the following graph . * Included in “ Investment banking ” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.We provide the following products and services through this segment.Equity products and services•We earn brokerage revenues on the sale of equity products to institutional clients . Client activity is influenced by a combination of general market activity and our Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients . Revenues on equity transactions are generally based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.5RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES•We provide various investment banking services including public and private equity financing for corporate clients and merger & acquisition and advisory services . Our investment banking activities include a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients ’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus.•Our global research department supports our institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on a wide variety of companies . This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries , including consumer , energy , financial services , healthcare , industrial , mining and natural resources , real estate , technology and communications , and transportation . Research reports are made available to both institutional and retail clients.Fixed income products and services•We earn revenues from institutional clients who purchase and sell both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products , primarily municipal , corporate , government agency and mortgage-backed bonds , and whole loans . We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate client transactions.•Our investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor , placement agent or underwriter to various issuers , including private and public corporate entities , state and local government agencies ( and their political subdivisions ) , housing agencies , and non-profit entities including healthcare and higher education institutions . •We enter into interest rate derivatives to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures that arise from our client activity , including a portion of our trading inventory . In addition , we conduct a “ matched book ” derivatives business where we may enter into interest rate derivative transactions with clients . In this matched book business , for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client , we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third-party financial institution.Tax credit funds•We act as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and/or provide a mechanism for banks and other institutions to meet their Community Reinvestment Act ( “ CRA ” ) obligations throughout the U.S. We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.Asset ManagementOur Asset Management segment earns asset management and related administrative fees for providing asset management , portfolio management and related administrative services to retail and institutional clients . This segment oversees a portion of our fee-based AUA for our PCG clients through our Asset Management Services division ( “ AMS ” ) and through Raymond James Trust , N.A . ( “ RJ Trust ” ) . This segment also provides asset management services through Carillon Tower Advisers and affiliates ( collectively , “ Carillon Tower Advisers ” ) for certain retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions , institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage.Management fees in this segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) in both AMS ( including the portion of fee-based AUA in PCG that is overseen by AMS ) and Carillon Tower Advisers , where investment decisions are made by in-house or third-party portfolio managers or investment committees . The fee rates applied are dependent upon various factors , including the distinctive services provided and the level of assets within each client relationship . The fee rates applied in Carillon Tower Advisers may also vary based on the account objective ( i.e. , equity , fixed income , or balanced ) . Our AUM are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets , including transfers between fee-based accounts and traditional transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment . Fees are generally collected quarterly and are based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter ( particularly in AMS ) or the end of the quarter , or based on average daily balances throughout the quarter.Our Asset Management segment also earns administrative fees on certain fee-based assets within PCG that are not overseen by our Asset Management segment , but for which the segment provides administrative support ( e.g. , record-keeping ) .6RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur AUM and our Carillon Tower Advisers AUM by objective as of September 30 , 2020 are presented in the following graphs.RJ BankRJ Bank is a national bank that provides various types of loans , including corporate loans ( commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) , commercial real estate ( “ CRE ” ) and CRE construction ) , tax-exempt loans , residential loans , securities-based loans ( “ SBL ” ) and other loans . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) -insured deposit accounts , including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . RJ Bank generates net interest income principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of securities , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.As of September 30 , 2020 , corporate and tax-exempt loans represented approximately 57 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , of which 87 % were U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities ( “ MBS ” ) and agency collateralized mortgage obligations ( “ CMOs ” ) and is classified as available-for-sale . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients.The following graph details the composition of RJ Bank ’ s total assets as of September 30 , 2020.7RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOtherOur Other segment includes our private equity investments , interest income on certain corporate cash balances , and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF , including the interest costs on our public debt . The Other segment also includes reduction in workforce expenses associated with certain position eliminations that occurred in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the economic environment.Our private equity portfolio includes various direct investments , as well as investments in third-party private equity funds and various legacy private equity funds which we sponsor.HUMAN CAPITALOur “ associates ” ( which include our employee financial advisors and all of our other employees , and independent contractor financial advisors ) are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As a human-capital intensive business , the long-term success of our firm depends on our people . Our goal is to ensure that we have the right talent , in the right place , at the right time . We do that through our commitment to attracting , developing and retaining our associates.We strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share our values . We have competitive programs dedicated to selecting new talent and enhancing the skills of our associates . In our recruiting efforts , we strive to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for our roles . To that end , we have strong relationships with a variety of industry associations that represent diverse professionals and with diversity groups at the colleges and universities where we recruit . Among other opportunities , we offer selected students and recent graduates summer internships and pipeline programs across many areas of the firm , which may lead to permanent roles . Individuals who want to become financial advisors in our PCG segment can gain relevant branch experience through our Wealth Management Associate Program or move to our Advisor Mastery Program and begin building their client base.We have designed a compensation structure , including an array of benefit plans and programs , that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective associates . We also offer our associates the opportunity to participate in a variety of professional and leadership development programs . Our extensive program catalog includes a variety of industry , product , technical , professional , business development , leadership and regulatory topics . These programs are available online and in-person . In addition , we have a variety of mentoring programs in place to support the development of our associates and expand their networks within the firm . We have a department dedicated to providing practice education and management resources to our PCG financial advisors . We also offer these advisors the opportunity to participate in conferences and workshops , and we offer resources and coaching at all levels to help them grow their businesses . These include separate national conferences for our employee and independent contractor financial advisor channels , each of which is attended by thousands of our advisors and their families each year.We seek to retain our associates by using their feedback to create and continually enhance programs that support their needs . We use firmwide pulse surveys to solicit feedback from our associates . We have a formal annual goal setting and performance review processes for our employees . We have a values-based culture , an important factor in retaining our associates , which is memorialized in a culture “ blueprint ” that is communicated to all associates . Our training to share and communicate our culture to all associates plays an important part in this process . We are committed to having a diverse workforce , and an inclusive work environment is a natural extension of our culture . We have recently renewed our commitment to ensuring that all our associates feel welcomed , valued , respected and heard so that they can fully contribute their unique talents for the benefit of clients , their careers , our firm and our communities . We also invest substantial resources in the community-supporting organizations that are dedicated to improving the lives of diverse individuals . Our firmwide diversity and inclusion advisory council stewards the firm ’ s efforts and provides guidance on priorities . This council is composed of associate representatives from all areas of our business and locations where we operate . We also have firmwide and business unit-specific diversity and inclusion networks , which host various events and conferences to educate and support our diversity and inclusion efforts . We monitor and evaluate various turnover and attrition metrics throughout our management teams . Our annualized voluntary turnover is relatively low , as is the case for turnover of our top performers , a record which we attribute to our strong values-based culture , commitment to career development , and attractive compensation and benefit programs . Importantly , our financial advisor attrition rate is even lower . As of September 30 , 2020 , we had approximately 14,800 employees ( including 3,404 employee financial advisors ) and 4,835 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.8RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel at various locations who are responsible for processing securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , the receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our securities brokerage operations.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a customized platform for our businesses . These include a platform for financial advisors designed to allow them to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses ; systems that support institutional and retail sales and trading activity from initiation to settlement and custody ; and thorough security protocols to protect firm and client information.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect our own information and that of our clients . We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and firm information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or other business disruptions . We have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have devoted significant resources to maintaining those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida , one of our operations processing or data center sites ( located in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee or Michigan ) , and our branch and office locations throughout the U.S. , Canada and Europe.In response to the coronavirus ( “ COVID-19 ” ) pandemic , we activated certain aspects of our business continuity program during 2020 endeavoring to protect our associates and our clients . As a result , nearly all of our associates transitioned to working remotely , while still maintaining our high standards of client service . The firm continues to monitor the pandemic and has developed a phased approach to reopening our offices based on regional indicators of infection positivity rates , and has and will continue to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.COMPETITIONThe financial services industry is intensely competitive . We compete with many other financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services to individual clients , usually with lower levels of service , and , more recently , financial technology ( “ fintech ” ) firms . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , services , product selection , performance records , location and reputation in local markets.Our ability to compete effectively is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to develop or attract , retain and motivate qualified financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONThe following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to us as a participant in the financial services industry and , in particular , the banking and securities sectors . The framework includes extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws , as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business . This framework is intended to protect our clients , the integrity of the financial markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders . These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities , as well as our ability to fund RJF from our regulated subsidiaries , which include RJ Bank , RJ Trust and our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced . A change in applicable statutes or regulations or in regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.We continue to experience a period of notable changes in financial regulation and supervision . We continue to monitor the likelihood of changes in taxation and regulations due to changes in the political environment . Based upon the outcome of the most recent U.S. federal elections , the likelihood of changes in both corporate and individual taxation , as well as regulations , has likely increased . These changes could have a significant impact on our business , financial condition , results of operations 9RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESand cash flows in the future ; however , we can not predict the exact changes or quantify their potential impacts . ( see “ Item 1A - Risk Factors ” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) .Banking supervision and regulationRJF is a bank holding company ( “ BHC ” ) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 , as amended ( the “ BHC Act ” ) , that has made an election to be a financial holding company ( “ FHC ” ) and is subject to regulation , oversight and consolidated supervision , including periodic examination , by the Fed . Under the system of “ functional regulation ” established under the BHC Act , the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries , with the Fed exercising a supervisory role . Such “ functionally regulated ” subsidiaries include our broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) , such as Raymond James & Associates , Inc. ( “ RJ & A ” ) and Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) , investment advisors registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities , and our depository institution and trust company chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) .RJ Bank is a national bank and insured depository institution regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our trust company non-depository subsidiary , RJ Trust , is also regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC . The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and , with respect to the Fed , RJ Trust.Collectively , the rules and regulations of the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business , including , for example , lending practices , the receipt of deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , conduct and qualifications of personnel and , as discussed further in the following sections , capital requirements . This regulatory , supervisory and oversight framework is subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF , RJ Bank , RJ Trust and all of our other subsidiaries . As a part of their supervisory functions , the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC , and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and , in the case of the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC , for unsafe or unsound practices.Basel III and U.S. capital rulesBoth RJF and RJ Bank are subject to minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards . The OCC , the Fed and the FDIC published final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) and other capital provisions , and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums ( the “ U.S . Basel III Rules ” ) . The U.S. Basel III Rules : ( i ) increased the quantity and quality of regulatory capital ; ( ii ) established a capital conservation buffer ; and ( iii ) made changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow , including during favorable market conditions , and to return capital to shareholders , or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and future prospects could be adversely affected . See “ Item 1A - Risk Factors ” of this Form 10-K for more information.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary , and in certain cases , mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions and other factors . Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of : ( i ) Common Equity Tier 1 ( or “ CET1 ” ) , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ; ( ii ) Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets ; and ( iii ) capital conservation buffers.In July 2019 , the Fed issued a final rule to simplify and clarify a number of existing regulatory capital rules for certain banking organizations . The rule was effective on October 1 , 2019 , for revisions to the pre-approval requirements for the repurchase of common stock and became effective on April 1 , 2020 , for the amendments to simplify capital rules . The rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets , certain deferred tax assets , investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions , and minority interest . This rule also allows BHCs like RJF to repurchase common stock without prior approval from the Fed to the extent that the BHC is not subject to a separate legal or regulatory requirement to obtain prior approval . RJF would continue to need to obtain prior approval from the Fed if it were not “ well-capitalized ” or “ well-managed ” or if it were subject to any unresolved supervisory issues . Guidance from the Fed also indicates that RJF would need to inform the Fed in advance of repurchasing common stock in certain prescribed situations , such as if it were 10RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESexperiencing , or at risk of experiencing , financial weaknesses or considering expansion , either through acquisitions or other new activities . Further , Fed guidance indicates that , pursuant to the Fed ’ s general supervisory and enforcement authority , Fed supervisory staff should prevent a BHC from repurchasing its common stock if such action would be inconsistent with the BHC ’ s prospective capital needs and safe and sound operation.See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.Source of strengthThe Fed requires that BHCs , such as RJF , serve as a source of financial strength for any of its subsidiary depository institutions . The term “ source of financial strength ” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries . Under this requirement , RJF could be required to provide financial assistance to RJ Bank in the future should it experience financial distress.Transactions between affiliatesTransactions between ( i ) RJ Bank , RJ Trust or their subsidiaries on the one hand and ( ii ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the other hand are subject to compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W issued by the Fed . These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions ( including credit extensions from ( i ) RJ Bank , RJ Trust or their subsidiaries to ( ii ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates ) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms . These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between RJ Bank or RJ Trust and their subsidiaries.The Volcker Rule , a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act , generally prohibits certain transactions and imposes a market terms requirement on certain other transactions between ( i ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the one hand and ( ii ) covered funds for which RJF or its subsidiaries or affiliates serve as the investment manager , investment advisor , commodity trading advisor or sponsor , or other covered funds organized and offered by RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the other hand . See “ The Volcker Rule ” in the following section.Deposit insuranceSince RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . For banks with greater than $ 10 billion in assets , which includes RJ Bank , the FDIC ’ s current assessment rate calculation relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress , in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail.Prompt corrective actionThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( “ FDICIA ” ) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take “ prompt corrective action ” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements . FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks , such as RJ Bank : well-capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.An institution may be downgraded to , or deemed to be in , a capital category that is lower than the category indicated by its capital ratios if the institution is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters . FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations , management and capital distributions , as the capital category of an institution declines . Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital . Ultimately , critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs , such as RJF . However , the Fed is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level , based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC ’ s depository institution subsidiaries . In certain instances related to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary , the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary ’ s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee . Furthermore , in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC , this guarantee would take priority over the BHC ’ s general unsecured creditors . As of September 30 , 2020 , RJ Bank was categorized as well-capitalized.11RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESThe Volcker RuleRJF is subject to the Volcker Rule , which generally prohibits BHCs and their subsidiaries and affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest , sponsoring , or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds , subject to certain exceptions.We have proprietary private equity investments that meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule . The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in covered funds was July 2017 ; however , banking entities were able to apply for an extension to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain illiquid funds . The majority of our covered fund investments meet the criteria to be considered an illiquid fund under the Volcker Rule and we received approval from the Fed to continue to hold such investments until July 2022 . The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to attempt to realize the value of these investments in due course and to execute appropriate strategies to comply with the Volcker Rule at such time . However , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing covered fund portfolio.The Fed , OCC , FDIC , SEC , and Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( “ CFTC ” ) finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule in 2019 , which relate primarily to the Volcker Rule ’ s proprietary trading and compliance program requirements . The amendments do not change the Volcker Rule ’ s general prohibitions , but they offer certain clarifications and a simplified approach to compliance . In June 2020 , the Fed , OCC , FDIC , SEC and CFTC finalized further amendments to the Volcker Rule . The final rule includes new exclusions from the Volcker Rule ’ s general prohibition on banking entities investing in and sponsoring private equity funds , hedge funds , and certain other investment vehicles ( collectively , “ covered funds ” ) for credit funds , venture capital funds , family wealth management vehicles , and customer facilitation vehicles . The final rule also revises existing exclusions for foreign public funds , loan securitizations , and public welfare and small business funds . In addition , the final rules modify the “ Super 23 ” provisions of the Volcker Rule , which prohibit banking entities from extending credit to and entering into certain transactions with advised or sponsored covered funds , by exempting certain short-term extensions of credit , among several other previously prohibited transactions.Many of the amendments contained in the final rule address aspects of the existing regulations that have , since their adoption in 2013 , proven in practice to be complex and burdensome or to have unintended consequences . The final rule is intended to clarify and simplify compliance with the implementing regulations and permit additional fund activities that do not present the risks that the Volcker Rule was intended to address . The final rule became effective on October 1 , 2020 for all banking entities subject to the Volcker Rule , including RJF and its subsidiaries.Compensation practicesOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Fed . Compensation regulation in the financial industry continues to develop , and we expect these regulations to change over a number of years . The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with safety and soundness . The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements . The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016 , which have not yet been finalized.Community Reinvestment Act regulationsRJ Bank is subject to the CRA , which is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating . If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a FHC fails to maintain at least a “ satisfactory ” rating under the CRA , the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.The OCC issued a final rule comprehensively amending the CRA regulations applicable to RJ Bank and other OCC-regulated banks in May 2020 . At the core of the OCC ’ s final rule is a set of new general performance standards that establish more quantitative measures of CRA performance than the tests set forth in existing CRA regulations.While RJ Bank will be required to comply with the final rule by January 2023 , the OCC has deferred the decision of how key thresholds and benchmarks used in the rule will be applied to determine the level of performance necessary to achieve a particular performance rating to a future rulemaking process . As a result , the final rule creates some uncertainty for RJ Bank and other OCC-regulated banks in planning their CRA activities until that decision is made.12RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNeither the FDIC nor the Fed joined the OCC in issuing the final rule , and the Fed issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for the CRA regulations applicable to state-charted banks it supervises in September 2020 . State-chartered banks will therefore continue to operate under the FDIC ’ s and Fed ’ s CRA regulations rather than the OCC ’ s CRA regulations . In June 2020 , certain organizations filed suit against the OCC asking a court to issue an order setting the rule aside . In the same month , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval in an attempt to nullify the rule . This measure failed to pass a required U.S. Senate vote in October 2020 . These developments create further uncertainty for RJ Bank and others in planning their CRA activities.Other restrictionsFHCs , such as RJF , generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs . The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting , dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs or merchant banking activities.The Fed , however , has the authority to limit an FHC ’ s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible , and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the Fed . For example , if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as “ well-capitalized ” or “ well-managed , ” the Fed may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements , as well as additional limitations or conditions . If the deficiencies persist , the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.In addition , we are required to obtain prior Fed approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.Broker-dealer and securities regulationThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the U.S. Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations , including sales and trading practices , public offerings , publication of research reports , use and safekeeping of client funds and securities , capital structure , record-keeping , privacy requirements , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . Our primary U.S. broker-dealers , RJ & A and RJFS , are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states.Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the U.S. , we have additional offices primarily in Canada and Europe and are subject to regulations in those areas . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) ( e.g. , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges ) . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities regulators may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers , employees or other associated persons . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act ( “ SIPA ” ) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under SIPA , and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances.U.S . broker-dealer capitalBroker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others , and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form . These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain of the SEC ’ s financial stability rules , including the : ( i ) net capital rule ; ( ii ) customer protection rule ; ( iii ) record-keeping rules ; and ( iv ) notification rules.13RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESStandard of carePursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . In June 2019 , the SEC adopted a package of rule-makings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers , including Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS . Among other things , Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities . Form CRS requires that broker-dealers and investment advisers provide retail investors with a brief summary document containing simple , easy-to-understand information about the nature of the relationship between the parties . Since June 30 , 2020 , we have been required to comply with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS . Implementation of the regulations required us to review and modify our policies and procedures , as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls , satisfy additional disclosure obligations , and provide related education and training to financial advisors.Additionally , various states have proposed , or adopted , laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that may differ from the SEC ’ s new regulations , which will lead to additional implementation costs . The Department of Labor ( “ DOL ” ) has also reinstated the historical “ five-part test ” for determining who is an investment advice “ fiduciary ” when dealing with certain retirement plans and accounts and proposed a new exemption to allow investment advice fiduciaries to receive transaction-based compensation and engage in certain principal trades . We are studying and evaluating the proposal . The total impact of the DOL change on our business will not be fully known until the proposal is finalized and could lead to additional costs.Investment management regulationOur investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the U.S . The majority of our asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended ( the “ Investment Advisers Act ” ) , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended for the benefit of our clients.Anti-money laundering , economic sanctions , and anti-bribery and corruption regulationThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act ( “ BSA ” ) , as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( “ PATRIOT Act ” ) and the Customer Due Diligence Rule , contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions , including standards for verifying client identification at account opening , and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities . Through these and other provisions , the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism , money laundering or other suspicious activities . Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions.The U.S. Treasury ’ s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers economic and trade sanctions programs and enforces sanctions regulations with which all U.S. persons must comply . The European Union ( “ E.U. ” ) as well as various countries have also adopted economic sanctions programs targeted at countries , entities and individuals that are involved in terrorism , hostilities , embezzlement or human rights violations.In addition , various countries have adopted laws and regulations , including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K . Bribery Act , related to corrupt and illegal payments to , and hiring practices with regard to , government officials and others . The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and is subject to significant uncertainties that may be clarified only in the context of further regulatory guidance or enforcement proceedings.RJF and its affiliates have been required to implement and maintain internal policies , procedures , and controls to meet the compliance obligations imposed by such U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations concerning anti-money laundering , economic sanctions , and anti-bribery and corruption . Failure to meet the requirements of these regulations can result in supervisory action , including fines.Privacy and data protectionU.S . federal law establishes minimum federal standards for financial privacy by , among other provisions , requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information . U.S. state laws and regulations adopted under U.S. federal law impose obligations on RJF and its subsidiaries for protecting the confidentiality , integrity and availability of client information , and 14RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESrequire notice of data breaches to certain U.S. regulators and to clients . The SEC ’ s Regulation S-ID mandates the development and implementation of a written Identity Theft Prevention Program that is designed to detect , prevent , and mitigate identity theft . The California Consumer Privacy Act , which became effective on January 1 , 2020 , imposes privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents , including requiring companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers , and provides for a number of new rights for California residents . Similarly , the General Data Protection Regulation ( “ GDPR ” ) imposes additional requirements for companies that collect or store personal data of E.U . residents . GDPR expands the scope of the E.U . data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of E.U . residents , imposes a strict data protection compliance regime , and includes new rights for E.U . residents . We have adopted privacy policies and communicated required information relating to financial privacy and data security , in accordance with applicable laws . We continue to monitor regulations related to data privacy and protection on both a domestic and international level to assess requirements and impacts on our global business operations.Legislative and regulatory changes in connection with COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing numerous measures to help control the spread of the virus , including , among others , quarantines , travel restrictions and business curtailments . In addition , governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic , including the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( “ CARES ” ) Act in the U.S. , which aimed to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals.The CARES Act includes a broad range of provisions intended to support the U.S. economy . Among its provisions , the act allocates funds for a new Paycheck Protection Program that expands an existing Small Business Administration ( “ SBA ” ) loan guarantee program for small businesses to keep their employees on payroll and make other eligible payments . Currently , the firm does not act as a lender under these programs and facilities , and has no immediate plans to do so.The CARES Act also provides certain temporary regulatory relief for financial institutions , including RJF and its subsidiaries . The act permits financial institutions to temporarily suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as being a troubled debt restructuring ( “ TDR ” ) , including impairment for accounting purposes . We elected to apply the CARES Act relief to certain loan modifications that relate primarily to short-term payment deferrals and have not classified such modifications as TDRs . See “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management - Credit risk ” for further information on the impact of such loan modifications . The act also permits financial institutions to temporarily delay the implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses ( “ CECL ” ) model for estimating allowances for credit losses . In addition , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC issued a joint statement providing banking organizations optional temporary relief by delaying the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years , followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 ( i.e. , a five-year transition period ) . We did not delay our October 1 , 2020 initial adoption of the implementation of CECL and did not take the optional temporary relief by delaying the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital calculations.The CARES Act grants potential tax relief and liquidity to businesses , including corporate tax provisions that : temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards , increase interest expense deduction limitations , and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements . In addition , the CARES Act allows employers to defer the payment , including the deposit , of payroll taxes for the 2020 calendar year from March 27 , 2020 until December 31 , 2021 for 50 percent of such taxes and December 31 , 2022 for the remaining 50 percent.The CARES Act further provides a number of consumer finance protections . The act provides a range of forbearance rights with respect to any federally backed residential or multi-family mortgage loan and generally limits the ability of a lender or servicer to institute foreclosure or similar proceedings . The act additionally imposes a moratorium on evictions from dwellings of many tenants . On September 1 , 2020 , the Department of Health and Human services , through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , announced a nationwide order temporarily halting certain residential evictions . These provisions are consistent with supervisory guidance previously issued by federal banking agencies , which also stated that they would not criticize financial institutions for working with customers affected by the outbreak in a safe and sound manner . We have modified our processes to ensure full compliance and are working as appropriate to support affected businesses and individuals during this time . Many state and local authorities have also taken , or are considering taking , legislative , executive , or other action to respond to the economic disruptions caused by the spread of COVID-19 , including with respect to foreclosure and repossession moratoriums.The Company ’ s legislative and regulatory environment is continually changing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , and new or modified laws , regulations and guidance may be promulgated at very short notice.15RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOther non-U.S. regulationRaymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) is currently registered as an investment dealer in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are subject to regulation by IIROC , a SRO under the oversight of the securities commissions that make up the Canadian Securities Administrators . IIROC is responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and has been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members , including RJ Ltd. IIROC also requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund , whose primary role is investor protection . This fund provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to 1 million Canadian dollars ( “ CAD ” ) per client , with additional coverage of CAD 1 million for certain types of accounts . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Certain of our subsidiaries are registered in , and operate from , the U.K. which has a highly developed and comprehensive regulatory regime . Certain of these subsidiaries operate in the retail sector , providing investment and financial planning services to high-net-worth individuals , while others provide brokerage and investment banking services to institutional clients . These subsidiaries are authorized and regulated by the U.K. conduct regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority ( “ FCA ” ) , and have permission to carry out business in other E.U . countries as part of treaty arrangements ; however , these permissions may be negatively impacted by the terms and conditions of the U.K. ’ s withdrawal from the E.U . ( “ Brexit ” ) .As of September 30 , 2020 , we have entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain of our subsidiaries which are incorporated and operate in France and that provide investment and asset management services to high-net-worth individuals and brokerage services to institutional clients . These subsidiaries are both authorized and regulated by the French Regulatory Authority the L ’ Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution and Autorité des Marchés Financiers and have permission to carry out business in other E.U . countries as part of treaty arrangements . We expect the sale to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2021.In Europe , the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( together , “ MiFID II ” ) , generally took effect on January 3 , 2018 , and introduced comprehensive , new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the E.U. , including new trading venues , enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency , and additional investor protection requirements , among others . These reforms also changed the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research and mandated unbundling between execution and other major services , including research , for broker-dealers.16RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESITEM 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described in the following sections , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . The list of risk factors provided in the following sections is not exhaustive ; there may be other factors that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects . The following sections should be read in conjunction with “ Item 7 - Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in “ Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . In particular , see “ Item 7 - Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources ” for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk and “ Item 7 - Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” for additional information on our exposure and how we monitor and manage our market , credit , operational , compliance and certain other risks . RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected , and will likely continue to adversely affect , our business , financial condition , and results of operations.The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed and other measures intended to control the spread of the disease , including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business , such as stay-at-home orders , quarantines , travel bans , border closings , business closures and other similar measures , have had a significant impact on global economic conditions and have negatively impacted certain aspects of our business and results of operations , and may continue to do so in the future . Although certain economic conditions showed signs of improvement toward the end of fiscal 2020 , certain of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect our results in the future , including : lower net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to a significant reduction by the Federal Reserve of its benchmark short-term interest rate in response to the pandemic ; volatility in our brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues due to market uncertainty caused by the pandemic ; increased credit risk , particularly with regard to industries most vulnerable to the pandemic ( e.g. , airline , restaurant , gaming , entertainment/leisure and energy ) , which may continue to result in an elevated bank loan loss provision and charge-offs . In addition , should market conditions deteriorate further , or if there is a decline in equity markets similar to that experienced during our fiscal 2020 second quarter , the value of our clients ’ assets and certain of our investments would also be negatively affected . We may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of the continued spread of COVID-19 , resulting from restrictions on our employees ’ ability to travel , as well as temporary partial or full closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers , suppliers , or other vendors . We often recruit skilled professionals by visiting their offices or having them visit our offices . Although we have transitioned such visits to virtual meetings , continued travel restrictions or other disruptions that prevent us from meeting with professional prospects may adversely impact our ability to recruit such professional prospects . Further , the increased availability of remote working arrangements in response to the pandemic may intensify competition for prospective new associates and impair our ability to retain current associates . It may also become more difficult to maintain our distinctive corporate culture , which is in part dependent on a certain level of in-person interaction , in the face of a prolonged , large-scale industry shift to remote work . While we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks , the further spread of COVID-19 or a similar contagious disease could also impair the effectiveness of our executive officers or other associates who are necessary to conduct our business . In addition , any continued spread of COVID-19 or new outbreak could harm the operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for our business.If COVID-19 , or another highly infectious or contagious disease , continues to spread or the response to contain it is unsuccessful , we will likely experience further adverse effects on our business , financial condition , liquidity , and results of operations . A prolonged period of economic deterioration could ultimately result in impairment of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets . In addition , if conditions in financial markets further deteriorate as a result of the pandemic , our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained , which may require us to restructure debt or obtain additional financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.The extent of any of the previously-described effects on our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and can not be predicted , including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic , the development , distribution , and acceptance of an effective vaccine , the measures taken by various governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and the possible further impacts on the global economy . 19RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , investors , and associates . If we fail to address , or appear to fail to address , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues may include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , record-keeping , sales and trading practices , and associate misconduct . In addition , the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the risks inherent in the products and services we offer could also give rise to reputational risk . Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and reputational harm . Negative publicity about us , whether or not true , may also harm our reputation . Further , failures at other large financial institutions or other market participants , regardless of whether they relate to our activities , could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us , including harming the market perception of the financial system in general.We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets.We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , as well as economic output levels , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , prices of commodities , consumer confidence levels , international trade policy , and fiscal and monetary policy . For example , Fed policies determine , in large part , the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities , as well as our cash flows , such as those associated with client cash balances . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . In addition , our results of operations may be impacted by changes resulting from different political philosophies governing individual and corporate taxation , as well as regulation , which may result from the outcome of the recent federal elections in the U.S. Changes in tax law and regulation , or any market uncertainty caused by a change in the political environment , may negatively affect our business . Macroeconomic conditions may also directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , financial instrument valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits.In recent years , we experienced an operating environment that was favorable for many of our businesses , characterized by rising equity markets and higher levels of interest rates . However , the recent significant reduction by the Fed of its benchmark short-term interest rate , including to ameliorate the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic , has had a significant negative impact on our results , as we have certain assets and liabilities , primarily held in our PCG , RJ Bank and Other segments , which are sensitive to changes in interest rates . Fees we earn from third-party banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the RJBDP are also sensitive to changes in interest rates . These market interest rate declines will continue to negatively impact our results and cash flows in future quarters.In addition , if we were to experience a period of sustained downturn in the securities markets , credit market dislocations , reductions in the value of real estate , further increases in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , or other negative market factors , including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic , our revenues could be adversely impacted . Market volatility could also cause clients to move their investments to lower margin products , or withdraw them , which could have an adverse impact on our profitability . We could also experience a material reduction in trading volume and lower securities prices in times of market uncertainty , which would result in lower brokerage revenues , including losses on firm inventory . Conversely , periods of severe market volatility may result in a significantly higher level of transactions and other activity which may cause operational challenges that may result in losses . These can include , but are not limited to , trade errors , failed transaction settlements , late collateral calls to borrowers and counterparties , or interruptions to our system processing . The fair values of certain of our investments could also be negatively impacted , resulting in additional unrealized or realized losses on such investments . Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could lead to reduced profitability because certain of our expenses , including our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses , are fixed , and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited.U.S . markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in other parts of the world . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations may also be subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental or central bank policies , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and 20RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESpolitical developments . Concerns about Brexit and the stability of the E.U. ’ s sovereign debt could cause uncertainty and disruption in financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the future of the U.K. ’ s relationship with the E.U. , including future trading arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U. , following the expiration of the transition period on December 31 , 2020 . During the transition period of Brexit , we are taking steps to make certain changes to our European operations in an effort to ensure that , where possible , we can continue to provide cross-border services in E.U . member states without the need for separate regulatory authorizations in each member state . There is also continued uncertainty regarding the outcome of the E.U. ’ s financial support programs . It is possible that other E.U . member states may experience financial troubles in the future , or may choose to follow the U.K. ’ s lead and leave the E.U . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . We may be negatively impacted by budget pressures affecting U.S. state and local governments , as well as negative trends in the housing and labor markets , including those resulting directly or indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic . Investor concerns regarding these trends could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce our debt underwriting revenues . In addition , such factors could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading inventory.RJ Bank is affected primarily by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the U.S. and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; unemployment and under-employment rates ; real estate prices ; consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . Deterioration of market conditions , such as those we have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic , have and could continue to diminish loan demand , which may result in sales of loans at unattractive prices in order to reduce risk in our loan portfolio , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance , and result in higher loan loss provisions and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity or to easily access credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , such as limiting our recruiting of additional financial advisors , limiting lending , selling assets at unfavorable prices , and cutting or eliminating dividend payments . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by : the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings ; liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from distributing cash to the parent company ; limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries ; diminished access to the capital markets for RJF ; and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase our stock . Certain of our regulators have the authority , and under certain circumstances , the duty , to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent company.The availability of financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on various factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally . We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their obligations to us due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . This risk has been and may further be exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers ’ trading and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives as part of our trading operations . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivatives could result in losses.We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments . We manage the risk 21RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESassociated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by evaluating collateral and transaction levels on a recurring basis . Significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk . In addition , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults.We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals , including through offering C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , SBL and other loans . We also incur credit risk through our investments . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , or geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions , such as those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic , including the airline , restaurant , gaming , entertainment/leisure and energy sectors . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital.Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , sell loans at unattractive prices , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our securities . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy.We are exposed to market risk , including interest rate risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . Moreover , while there is no indication currently that the Fed plans to reduce its targeted Fed funds rate to a negative rate , if such a policy were to be adopted the cost to hold both firm and client deposits would have an adverse impact on our profitability.In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread and an increase in servicing fees received on cash swept to third-party banks as part of the RJBDP , our multi-bank sweep program . Conversely , in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread and lower RJBDP fees from third-party banks . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and private equity investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , foreign exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing our capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , if these companies go public and the size of our position relative to the public float , and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions.22RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSignificant volatility in our domestic clients ’ cash balances could negatively impact our net revenues and/or our ability to fund RJ Bank ’ s growth and may impact our regulatory ratios.The majority of RJ Bank ’ s deposits are primarily driven by the RJBDP , our multi-bank sweep program in which PCG clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into FDIC-insured , interest-bearing deposit accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks . The RJBDP is a source of relatively low-cost , stable deposits for RJ Bank and we rely heavily on the RJBDP to fund RJ Bank ’ s asset growth . A significant reduction in PCG clients ’ cash balances , a change in the allocation of that cash between RJ Bank and third-party banks within the RJBDP , or a transfer of cash away from the firm could significantly impact RJ Bank ’ s ability to continue growing interest-earning assets and/or require RJ Bank to use higher-cost deposit sources to grow interest-earning assets . The RJBDP also generates service fee income from third-party banks related to the deposits they receive through their participation in the RJBDP . If PCG clients were to materially increase their cash balances at a time when third-party bank demand for RJBDP deposits has been largely met , our ability to generate meaningful revenues from the placement of these incremental deposits would be adversely affected . In addition , our inability to deploy client cash to third-party banks through RJBDP would require us to retain more cash at RJ Bank or in our Client Interest Program , both of which may cause a significant increase in our assets . Such an increase in our assets may negatively impact certain of our regulatory ratios.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts , and asset management fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual fund and annuity companies.The asset management fees we are paid are dependent upon the value of client assets in fee-based accounts in our PCG segment , as well as AUM in our Asset Management segment . The value of our fee-based assets and AUM is impacted by market fluctuations and inflows or outflows of assets . As our PCG clients increasingly show a preference for fee-based accounts over traditional transaction-based accounts , a larger portion of our client assets are more directly impacted by market movements . Therefore , in periods of declining market values , the values of fee-based accounts and AUM may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our revenues . In addition , below-market investment performance by our funds , portfolio managers or financial advisors could result in reputational damage that might cause outflows or make it more difficult to attract new investors into our asset management products and thus , further impact our business and financial condition.Our asset management fees may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts . In addition , the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products , which generate lower fees than actively managed products . A continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would negatively affect our revenues , business and financial condition.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved . From time to time as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions , despite our risk mitigation policies , could impact our financial results.As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . Despite risk mitigation policies , we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our trading activities.We have made and , to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations , may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments . We may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we can not sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of 23RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIEStime to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments . In addition , even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.Any cyber-attack or other security breach of our technology systems , or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on , could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing , storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial , personal and other information in our computer systems and networks . There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber-attacks involving the theft , dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets , in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties . Like other financial services firms , we experience malicious cyber activity directed at our computer systems , software , networks and its users on a daily basis . This malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access , implantation of computer viruses or malware , and denial-of-service attacks . We also experience large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against the firm , our associates , or our clients . Additionally , like many large enterprises , since mid-March 2020 , we have shifted the majority of our associates to remote work arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . This change in our operating model has enabled us to successfully continue business operations , but also introduces potential new vulnerabilities to cyber threats . We seek to continuously monitor for and nimbly react to any and all such malicious cyber activity , and we develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misuse , misappropriation or corruption.Cyber-attacks can originate from a variety of sources , including third parties affiliated with foreign governments , organized crime or terrorist organizations . Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . Although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches . However , the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls , including our cyber threat analytics , data encryption and tokenization technologies , anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management programs , any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect , mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , equipment failure , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code , and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation , and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.We also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations , and we face similar risks relating to them . While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors , we can not be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach . In addition , in order to access our products and services , our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems.Notwithstanding the precautions we take , if a cyber-attack or other information security breach were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties , exposing us to liability . As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication , we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber-attacks to our customers . Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks , we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators . Further , successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants , whether or not we are affected , could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us , including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general , which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services.Further , in light of the high volume of transactions we process , the large number of our clients , partners and counterparties , the increasing sophistication of malicious actors , and our remote work environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , a cyber-attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack would take substantial amounts of time , and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable 24RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESinformation . During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.We may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws . In providing services to clients , we manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal , state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.A continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business.Our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : ( i ) successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems on a regular basis ; ( ii ) maintain the quality of the information contained in our data processing and communications systems ; ( iii ) address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and ( iv ) retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , including a systems malfunction or cyber-attack , failure by a third-party service provider , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities and derivative transactions . As a result of regulatory changes and the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interdependent as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.25RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our market , credit , operational , liquidity and legal and regulatory compliance risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective . While we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not always anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value . A failure to manage our growth adequately , including growth in the products or services we offer , or to manage our risk effectively , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.Financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest , which are routinely examined by U.S. federal and state regulators and SROs such as FINRA and are often used as the basis for claims for legal liability by plaintiffs in actions against us . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities . A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could result in material harm to our business and financial condition.We continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.We continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , partially due to the industry trend toward the separate payment for research and execution services . Our trading margins have been further compressed by the shift from high- to low-touch execution services , which has created additional competitive pressure . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.We face intense competition.We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , and location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time , there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry , which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See “ Item 1 - Business - Competition ” of this Form 10-K for additional information about our competitors.We compete directly with other national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , commercial banks , and investment advisors , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market , including financial technology companies , and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . For example , recently several commercial firms and other non-traditional competitors have applied for banking licenses or have entered into partnerships with banks to provide banking services . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to recruit , serve and retain our clients depends on the reputation , judgment , leadership , business generation capabilities and client service skills of our client-serving professionals , members of our executive committees , as well as 26RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESemployees who support revenue-generating professionals and their clients . To compete effectively we must attract , develop , and retain qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry is considerable . Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current associate ’ s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective associate ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our associates , which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional associates at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may work for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential associates who work for our competitors from joining us . We participate in the Protocol for Broker Recruiting ( “ Protocol ” ) , a voluntary agreement among many firms in the industry that governs , among other things , the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm . The ability to bring such customer data to a new broker-dealer generally means that the clients of the financial advisor are more likely to choose to open accounts at the advisor ’ s new firm . Participation is voluntary and it is possible that certain of our competitors will withdraw from the Protocol . If the broker-dealers from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent , or significantly limit , the transfer of client data , our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected and we could continue to experience claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts.A downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations , earnings and financial condition.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our client relationships . Such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability.We may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions . A credit rating downgrade would also result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on its $ 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement ( the “ Credit Facility ” ) , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information on the Credit Facility ) .Business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.We continue to grow , including through acquisitions and through our recruiting efforts . Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses , recruiting financial advisors or making strategic acquisitions or investments . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth.27RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESExpansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.Moreover , to the extent we pursue acquisitions , we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms . We may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully . Difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise capital or borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition , which could result in dilution or increased leverage . We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all.Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our investment banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . Our associates interact with clients , customers and counterparties on an ongoing basis . All associates are expected to exhibit the behaviors and ethics that are reflected in our framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients . Associate conduct on non–business matters , such as social issues , could be inconsistent with the Company ’ s policies and ethics and result in reputational harm to our business as a result of their employment or affiliation . If our associates improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to future regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over our assets under management . In addition , our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter or prevent every instance of associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected.We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of liability . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations primarily involving claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could also result in substantial liability.In challenging market conditions , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased . Litigation risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related to our investment recommendations , including the suitability of such recommendations or potential concentration of investments ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of third-party attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations . See “ Item 3 - Legal Proceedings ” of this Form 10-K for further information about legal matters.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements , and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying 28RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESassumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , derivatives , available-for-sale securities , certain loans and investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no directly observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior-period financial statements . For further discussion of our significant accounting estimates , policies and standards , see “ Item 7 - Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates ” and “ Item 7 - Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent accounting developments ” of this Form 10-K and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that also permits significant operations to be conducted out of remote locations as well as our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee corporate offices and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . In addition , since activating certain aspects of our business continuity plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to allow nearly all of our associates to work remotely , our associates ’ ability to relocate to a secondary location in the event of a power outage or other disruption is limited due to the pandemic . As previously mentioned , weather events could also adversely impact certain loans within RJ Bank ’ s portfolio.The phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest income and require significant operational work.The FCA , which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate ( “ LIBOR ” ) , has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021 . It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then . The discontinuance of LIBOR has resulted in significant uncertainty regarding the transition to suitable alternative reference rates and could adversely impact our business , operations , and financial results . Although the full impact of transition remains unclear , this change may have an adverse impact on the value of , return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products , including any LIBOR-based securities , loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities . If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected , there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments , which may also impact our net interest income and account and service fees . In addition , LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest earned on certain assets and a reduction in the value of certain assets.To facilitate an orderly transition away from LIBOR , we have established an enterprise-wide initiative to assess and implement necessary changes to our contracts , systems , processes , documentation , and models . These changes may also impact our existing transaction data , products , internal infrastructure , and valuation processes.We are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks . We have elected to self-insure our errors and omissions liability and 29RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESour employee-related health care benefit plans . We have self-insured retention risk related to our property and casualty , workers compensation and general liability benefit plans.While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , claims associated with risks we have retained either through our self-insurance retention or by self-insuring may exceed our recorded reserves which could negatively impact future earnings . Insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms are highly regulated and such regulation may increase the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Financial services firms operate in an evolving regulatory environment . The industry has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry , as well as a high degree of scrutiny from various regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . For example , the Dodd-Frank Act resulted in sweeping changes to the regulatory regime , including a significant increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry . Penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have been substantial in recent years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws , rules and regulations . Existing and new laws and regulations could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional compliance costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act , which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . Any action taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make such products and services less attractive , impose additional compliance measures , or result in fines , penalties or required remediation.We are also required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading , due to our underwriting and trading activities and our investments in covered funds , we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased operational and compliance costs and changes to our private equity investments . Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies , procedures and practices.Broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to : sales and trading methods ; trade practices among broker-dealers ; use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities ; capital structure of securities firms ; anti-money laundering efforts ; recordkeeping ; and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business.The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition , we have certain international business operations that are subject to laws , regulations , and standards in the countries in which we operate . Any violations of these laws , regulations or standards could subject us to a range of potential regulatory events or outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects including potential adverse impacts on continued operations in the relevant international jurisdiction.Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . There is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by RJF and its subsidiaries . In addition , from time to time , RJF and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional findings with respect to supervisory , compliance or other regulatory deficiencies , which could subject us to additional liability , including penalties and restrictions on our business activities . Among other things , these restrictions could limit our ability to make investments , complete acquisitions , expand into new 30RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESbusiness lines , pay dividends on our common stock and/or engage in share repurchases . See “ Item 1 - Business - Regulation ” of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our regulatory environment.Changes in requirements relating to the standard of conduct for broker-dealers applicable under federal and state law have increased our costs.In June 2019 , the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers , including Regulation Best Interest . Since June 30 , 2020 , Regulation Best Interest requires , among other things , a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities . The regulation imposes heightened standards on broker-dealers , and we have incurred substantial costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures , including associated supervisory and compliance controls . We anticipate that we will continue to incur costs in the future to comply with the standard.In addition to the SEC , various states have adopted , or are considering adopting , laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that , as written , differ from the SEC ’ s new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs . Implementation of the new SEC regulations , as well as any new state rules that are adopted addressing similar matters , has resulted in ( and may continue to result in ) increased costs related to compliance , legal , operations and information technology.Numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to our investment management activities may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.As some of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in additional operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . While it is not possible to determine the extent of the long-term impact of any new laws or regulations that have been promulgated , or initiatives that have been or may be proposed , even the short-term impact of preparing for or implementing changes to our infrastructure and processes could negatively impact the ways we conduct business and increase our compliance and legal costs . Conformance with any new law or regulations could also make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect our product and service offerings.Investment management businesses have been affected by the SEC ’ s Regulation Best Interest which , in addition to creating a standard of care a financial advisor owes its clients , also impacts investment advice provided by investment advisers . The result has been increased scrutiny within the industry regarding how advisory products are offered and sold . Such changes could impact our revenues and profitability . In addition , the SEC and other regulators continue to scrutinize broker-dealer platforms . With respect to mutual funds , for example , the SEC ’ s well-publicized Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative has required Raymond James ’ affiliated broker-dealers and others to make changes to the availability of mutual funds and mutual fund share classes on their distribution platforms . Such changes could impact mutual fund sales , including those sponsored by our subsidiaries , and affect our profitability.In addition , U.S. and foreign governments have taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to do so including expanding current ( or enacting new ) standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , MiFID II in the E.U . requires the use of “ hard dollars ” for research , as opposed to the use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors . The research relied on in our investment management activities in the investment decision-making process is typically generated internally by our investment analysts or external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research is generally used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third-party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars were to become limited in the U.S. , we may have to bear some of these additional costs.New regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products , including additional recordkeeping and disclosure requirements , may also impact our asset management business and result in increased costs.Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.As discussed in “ Item 1 - Business - Regulation ” of this Form 10-K , RJF and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the U.S. and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve 31RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESquantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items , as calculated under regulatory guidelines . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory ( and potentially discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and financial condition . Further , we are subject to the SEC ’ s Uniform Net Capital Rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . RJ Ltd. is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulations in Canada by IIROC . Additionally , our U.S. entities operating as nonbank custodians of Individual Retirement Accounts ( “ IRAs ” ) must also satisfy certain Internal Revenue Service ( “ IRS ” ) regulations in order to accept new IRA and qualified plans and retain the accounts for which it serves as nonbank custodian . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that RJF may need to make payments on any of its obligations . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.The Basel III regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our profitability.The Fed , the OCC and the FDIC have implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The U.S. Basel III Rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . We became subject to the requirements under the final U.S. Basel III Rules as of January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The capital requirements stipulated under the U.S. Basel III Rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.As a financial holding company , RJF ’ s liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries , which may be subject to regulatory restrictions.RJF as a financial holding company depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations , including its debt service obligations . RJF ’ s subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to RJF . RJF ’ s broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses . These requirements may hinder RJF ’ s ability to access funds from its subsidiaries . RJF may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock . The federal banking regulators , including the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC , as well as the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority and under certain circumstances , the obligation , to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise , including RJF and its bank subsidiaries.RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . An unfavorable CRA rating or a successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , and the imposition of restrictions on mergers , acquisitions and expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.As discussed in “ Item 1 - Business - Regulation ” of this Form 10-K , certain amendments to the CRA have not yet been finalized . These developments create further uncertainty for RJ Bank and others in planning their CRA activities . Any revisions to the final regulations that implement the CRA may negatively impact our business , including through increased costs related to compliance.ITEM 1B .

( “ RJF , ” the “ firm ” or the “ Company ” ) is a leading diversified financial services company providing private client group , capital markets , asset management , banking and other services to individuals , corporations and municipalities . The firm , together with its subsidiaries , is engaged in various financial services activities , including providing investment management services for retail and institutional clients , the underwriting , distribution , trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products . The firm also provides corporate and retail banking services , and trust services . We operate predominately in the U.S. and , to a lesser extent , in Canada , the United Kingdom ( “ U.K. ” ) , and other parts of Europe.Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) under the symbol “ RJF. ” As a bank holding company and financial holding company , RJF is subject to supervision , examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) .Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , advisors , associates and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through five segments . Our business segments are Private Client Group ( “ PCG ” ) , Capital Markets , Asset Management and Raymond James Bank ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . Our Other segment includes our private equity investments , interest income on certain corporate cash balances and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to our business segments , including the interest costs on our public debt.The following graph depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our business segments for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2019 . * The preceding chart does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.PRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide financial planning and securities transaction services through a branch office network . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice . Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting , transitional cost assistance , and retention purposes.Total client assets under administration ( “ AUA ” ) in our PCG segment as of September 30 , 2019 were $ 798.4 billion , of which $ 409.1 billion related to fee-based accounts ( “ fee-based AUA ” ) . We had 8,011 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2019.3RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESEmployee financial advisorsEmployee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to retail clients . Compensation for these financial advisors primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans.Independent contractor financial advisorsOur financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , receive a higher payout percentage than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , and on a limited basis , they are permitted to conduct certain other approved business activities , such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services.Products and servicesIrrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investment products and services , including both third-party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues from this segment are typically driven by AUA and are generally either asset-based or transactional in nature . The proportion of our brokerage revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced.PCG segment net revenues the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2019 are presented in the following graph . * Included in “ Brokerage revenues ” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.We provide the following products and services through this segment : •Investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules.•Portfolio management services for which we charge either a fee computed as a percentage of the assets in the client ’ s account or a flat periodic fee.•Insurance and annuity products.•Professionally managed mutual funds.•Support to third-party product partners , including sales and marketing support , product availability and distribution , and accounting and administrative services.4RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES•Administrative services to banks to which we sweep a portion of our clients ’ cash deposits as part of the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , our multi-bank sweep program . Fees received from third-party banks for these services are variable in nature and fluctuate based on client cash balances in the program , as well as the level of short-term interest rates relative to interest paid to clients on balances in the RJBDP . PCG also earns servicing fees from RJ Bank , which are based on the number of accounts that are swept to RJ Bank . These fees are eliminated in consolidation.•Margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed based on current interest rates.•Custodial , trading , research and other support and services ( including access to clients ’ account information and the services of the Asset Management segment ) to the independent registered investment advisors who are affiliated with us.•Securities borrowing and lending activities with other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties . The net revenues of this business consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities.•Diversification strategies and alternative investment products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors.CAPITAL MARKETSOur Capital Markets segment conducts institutional sales , securities trading , equity research , investment banking and the syndication and management of investments that qualify for tax credits ( referred to as our “ tax credit funds ” ) . Within our management structure , we distinguish between activities that support equity and fixed income products and services.Capital Markets segment net revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2019 are presented in the following graph . * Included in “ Investment banking ” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.We provide the following services through this segment.Equity products and services•We earn brokerage revenues on the sale of equity products to institutional clients . Client activity is influenced by a combination of general market activity and our Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients . Revenues on equity transactions are generally based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution.•We provide various investment banking services including public and private equity financing for corporate clients and merger & acquisition and advisory services . Our investment banking activities include a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients ’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus.5RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES•Our global research department supports our institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on a wide variety of companies . This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries , including consumer , energy , financial services , healthcare , industrial , real estate , technology and communications , and transportation . Research reports are made available to both institutional and retail clients.Fixed income products and services•We earn revenues from institutional clients who purchase and sell both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products , primarily municipal , corporate , government agency and mortgage-backed bonds , and whole loans . We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate client transactions.•Our fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor , placement agent or underwriter to various issuers , including state and local government agencies ( and their political subdivisions ) , housing agencies , and non-profit entities including healthcare and higher education institutions . When underwriting new issue securities , we may agree to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submission of a competitive bid.•We enter into interest rate derivatives to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures that arise from our client activity , including a portion of our trading inventory . In addition , we conduct a “ matched book ” derivatives business where we may enter into interest rate derivative transactions with clients . In this matched book business , for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client , we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third-party financial institution.Tax credit funds•We act as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and/or provide a mechanism for banks and other institutions to meet their Community Reinvestment Act ( “ CRA ” ) obligations throughout the U.S. We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.ASSET MANAGEMENTOur Asset Management segment earns asset management and related administrative fees for providing portfolio management and related administrative services for retail and institutional clients . This segment oversees a portion of our fee-based AUA for our PCG clients through our asset management services division ( “ AMS ” ) and through Raymond James Trust , N.A . ( “ RJ Trust ” ) . This segment also provides asset management services through Carillon Tower Advisers and affiliates ( collectively , “ Carillon Tower Advisers ” ) for certain retail accounts managed on behalf of third-party institutions , institutional accounts and proprietary mutual funds that we manage.Management fees in this segment are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of our fee-billable financial assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) in both AMS ( including the portion of fee-based AUA in PCG that is overseen by AMS ) and Carillon Tower Advisers , where investment decisions are made by in-house or third-party portfolio managers or investment committees . The fee rates applied are dependent upon various factors , including the distinctive services provided and the level of assets within each client relationship . The fee rates applied in Carillon Tower Advisers may also vary based on the account objective ( i.e. , equity , fixed income , or balanced ) . Our AUM are impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets , including transfers between fee-based accounts and traditional transaction-based accounts within our PCG segment . Fees are generally collected quarterly and are based on balances as of the beginning of the quarter ( particularly in AMS ) or the end of the quarter , or based on average daily balances.Our Asset Management segment also earns administrative fees on certain fee-based assets within PCG that are not overseen by our Asset Management segment , but for which the segment provides administrative support ( e.g. , record-keeping ) .6RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur AUM and our Carillon Tower Advisers AUM by objective as of September 30 , 2019 are presented in the following graphs.RJ BANKRJ Bank is a national bank that provides various types of loans , including corporate loans ( commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) , commercial real estate ( “ CRE ” ) and CRE construction ) , tax-exempt loans , residential loans , securities-based loans ( “ SBL ” ) and other loans . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) -insured deposit accounts , including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of securities , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.As of September 30 , 2019 , corporate and tax-exempt loans represented approximately 62 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , of which 88 % were U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities ( “ MBS ” ) and collateralized mortgage obligations ( “ CMOs ” ) and is classified as available-for-sale . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients.RJ Bank had total assets of $ 25.52 billion at September 30 , 2019 , which are detailed in the following graph.7RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOTHEROur Other segment includes our private equity investments , interest income on certain corporate cash balances , and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF , including the interest costs on our public debt.Our private equity portfolio includes various direct and third-party private equity investments and various legacy private equity funds which we sponsor.EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORSOur employees , including employee financial advisors , and independent contractors ( collectively “ associates ” ) are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As of September 30 , 2019 , we had approximately 14,200 employees and 4,710 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel at various locations who are responsible for processing securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , the receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our securities brokerage operations.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a customized platform for our businesses . These include a platform for financial advisors designed to allow them to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses ; systems that support institutional and retail sales and trading activity through to settlement and custody ; and thorough security protocols to protect firm and client information.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information and that of our clients . We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and firm information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . We have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a full time staff devoted to maintaining those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida , one of our operations processing or data center sites ( located in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee or Michigan ) , and our branch and office locations throughout the U.S. , Canada and Europe.COMPETITIONThe financial services industry is intensely competitive . We compete with many other financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services to individual clients , usually with lower levels of service , and , more recently , financial technology ( “ fintech ” ) firms . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , services , product selection , performance records , location and reputation in local markets.Our ability to compete effectively is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONThe following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to RJF as a participant in the financial services industry and , in particular , the banking and securities sectors . The framework includes extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws , as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which RJF does business , and is intended to protect our clients , the integrity of the financial markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders . These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities , as well as our ability to fund RJF from our regulated subsidiaries , which include RJ Bank and our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to 8RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESthe particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced . A change in applicable statutes or regulations or in regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.We continue to experience a period of notable change in financial regulation and supervision . These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business . Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux and may be subject to amendment in the near future . As a result , we can not specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations ( see Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . Banking supervision and regulationRJF is a bank holding company ( “ BHC ” ) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 , as amended ( the “ BHC Act ” ) , that has made an election to be a financial holding company ( “ FHC ” ) and is subject to regulation , oversight and consolidated supervision , including periodic examination , by the Fed . Under the system of “ functional regulation ” established under the BHC Act , the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries , with the Fed exercising a supervisory role . Such “ functionally regulated ” subsidiaries include our broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) , such as Raymond James & Associates ( “ RJ & A ” ) and Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) , investment advisors registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities , and our depository institution and trust company chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) .RJ Bank is a national bank and insured depository institution regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our trust company non-depository subsidiary , RJ Trust , is also regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC . The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and , with respect to the Fed , RJ Trust.Collectively , the rules and regulations of the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business , including , for example , lending practices , the receipt of deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , conduct and qualifications of personnel and , as discussed further in the following sections , capital requirements . This regulatory , supervisory and oversight framework is subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF , RJ Bank , RJ Trust and all of our other subsidiaries . As a part of their supervisory functions , the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC , and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and , in the case of the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC , for unsafe or unsound practices.Basel III and U.S. capital rulesBoth RJF and RJ Bank are subject to minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards . The OCC , the Fed and the FDIC published final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums ( the “ U.S . Basel III Rules ” ) . The U.S. Basel III Rules : ( i ) increased the quantity and quality of regulatory capital ; ( ii ) established a capital conservation buffer ; and ( iii ) made changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1 , 2015 , subject to applicable phase-in periods . The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank on January 1 , 2016 . The capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions and to return capital to shareholders , or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” within this report for more information.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary , and in certain cases , mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions and other factors . Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of : ( i ) Common Equity Tier 1 ( or “ CET1 ” ) , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ; ( ii ) Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets ; and ( iii ) capital conservation buffers.In July 2019 , the Fed issued a final rule to simplify and clarify a number of existing regulatory capital rules for certain banking organizations . Specifically , the rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets , certain deferred tax assets , investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions , and minority interest . This rule would also allow BHCs like RJF to repurchase common stock without prior approval from the Fed to the extent that the BHC is not subject to a separate legal or regulatory requirement to obtain prior approval . RJF would continue to need to obtain prior approval from the Fed if it were not “ well-capitalized ” 9RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESor “ well-managed ” or if it were subject to any unresolved supervisory issues . Guidance from the Fed also indicates that RJF would need to inform the Fed in advance of repurchasing common stock if it was experiencing , or at risk of experiencing , financial weaknesses or considering expansion , either through acquisitions or other new activities . The rule becomes effective on April 1 , 2020 , for the amendments to simplify capital rules , and was effective on October 1 , 2019 , for revisions to the pre-approval requirements for the repurchase of common stock . We are evaluating the impact of the rule on our regulatory capital requirements.See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.Stress testingOn May 24 , 2018 , the Economic Growth , Regulatory Relief , and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law , making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act , as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations . Among other things , the law raises the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing and liquidity coverage requirements for BHCs to $ 250 billion , subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $ 100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns . The Fed , the OCC and the FDIC have since issued related guidance and regulations . As a result of these changes , and given our current asset size , RJF and RJ Bank are currently no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing requirements.Source of strengthThe Fed requires that BHCs , such as RJF , serve as a source of financial strength for any of its subsidiary depository institutions . The term “ source of financial strength ” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries . Under this requirement , RJF could be required to provide financial assistance to RJ Bank in the future should it experience financial distress.Transactions between affiliatesTransactions between ( i ) RJ Bank , RJ Trust or their subsidiaries on the one hand and ( ii ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the other hand are subject to compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W issued by the Fed . These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions ( including credit extensions from ( i ) RJ Bank , RJ Trust or their subsidiaries to ( ii ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates ) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms . These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between RJ Bank or RJ Trust and their subsidiaries.The Volcker Rule , a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act , generally prohibits certain transactions and imposes a market terms requirement on certain other transactions between ( i ) RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the one hand and ( ii ) covered funds for which RJF or its subsidiaries or affiliates serve as the investment manager , investment advisor , commodity trading advisor or sponsor , or other covered funds organized and offered by RJF or its other subsidiaries or affiliates on the other hand . See “ The Volcker Rule ” in the following section.Deposit insuranceSince RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . For banks with greater than $ 10 billion in assets , which includes RJ Bank , the FDIC ’ s current assessment rate calculation relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress , in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail.Prompt corrective actionThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ( “ FDICIA ” ) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take “ prompt corrective action ” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements . FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks , such as RJ Bank : well-capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.An institution may be downgraded to , or deemed to be in , a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters . FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations , management and capital distributions , as the capital category 10RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESof an institution declines . Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital . Ultimately , critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs , such as RJF . However , the Fed is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level , based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC ’ s depository institution subsidiaries . In certain instances related to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary , the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary ’ s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee . Furthermore , in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC , this guarantee would take priority over the BHC ’ s general unsecured creditors.The Volcker RuleRJF is subject to the Volcker Rule , which generally prohibits BHCs and their subsidiaries and affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest , sponsoring , or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds , subject to certain exceptions.We have private equity investments , some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule . The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in covered funds was July 2017 ; however , banking entities were able to apply for an extension to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain illiquid funds . The majority of our covered fund investments meet the criteria to be considered an illiquid fund under the Volcker Rule and we received approval from the Fed to continue to hold such investments until July 2022 . The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to attempt to realize the value of these investments in due course and to execute appropriate strategies to comply with the Volcker Rule at such time . However , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio.The Fed , OCC , FDIC , SEC , and Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( “ CFTC ” ) finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule in 2019 , which relate primarily to the Volcker Rule ’ s proprietary trading and compliance program requirements . The amendments do not change the Volcker Rule ’ s general prohibitions , but they offer certain clarifications and a simplified approach to compliance . While the agencies adopted certain limited changes to the Volcker Rule ’ s covered fund-related provisions , the agencies noted that they continue to consider other aspects of the covered fund provisions , and intend to issue a separate proposed rulemaking that specifically addresses those areas.Compensation practicesOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Fed . Compensation regulation in the financial industry continues to develop , and we expect these regulations to change over a number of years . The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with safety and soundness . The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements . The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016 , which have not yet been finalized.Other restrictionsFHCs , such as RJF , generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs . The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting , dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs or merchant banking activities.The Fed , however , has the authority to limit an FHC ’ s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible , and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the Fed . For example , if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as “ well-capitalized ” or “ well-managed , ” the Fed may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements , as well as additional limitations or conditions . If the deficiencies persist , the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.RJ Bank is subject to the CRA , which is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating . If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a FHC fails to maintain at least a “ satisfactory ” rating under the CRA , the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.11RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESIn addition , we are required to obtain prior Fed approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.Broker-dealer and securities regulationThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the U.S. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations , including sales and trading practices , public offerings , publication of research reports , use and safekeeping of client funds and securities , capital structure , record-keeping , privacy requirements , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states.Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the U.S. , we have additional offices primarily in Canada and Europe and are subject to regulations in those areas . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) ( e.g. , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges ) . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities regulators may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers , employees or other associated persons . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act ( “ SIPA ” ) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under SIPA , and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances.U.S . broker-dealer capitalBroker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others , and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form . These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates . The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules , many of which are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries , including changes to the : ( i ) net capital rule ; ( ii ) customer protection rule ; ( iii ) record-keeping rules ; and ( iv ) notification rules.Fiduciary dutyPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . In June 2019 , the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers , including Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS . Among other things , Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities . Form CRS requires that broker-dealers and investment advisers provide retail investors with a brief summary document containing simple , easy-to-understand information about the nature of the relationship between the parties . Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS have a compliance date of June 30 , 2020 , and we anticipate that implementation of the regulations will require us to review and modify our policies and procedures , as well as the associated supervisory and compliance controls , which may lead to additional costs.In addition to the SEC , various states have proposed or are considering adopting laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that , as written , differ from the SEC ’ s new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs if adopted.Investment management regulationOur investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the U.S . The majority of our asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended ( the “ Investment Advisers Act ” ) , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our 12RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESasset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.Anti-money laundering , economic sanctions , and anti-bribery and corruption regulationThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act ( “ BSA ” ) , as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( “ PATRIOT Act ” ) , contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions , including standards for verifying client identification at account opening , and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities . Through these and other provisions , the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism , money laundering or other suspicious activities . Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions.The U.S. Treasury ’ s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers economic and trade sanctions programs and enforces sanctions regulations with which all U.S. persons must comply . The European Union ( “ E.U. ” ) as well as various countries have also adopted economic sanctions programs targeted at countries , entities and individuals that are involved in terrorism , hostilities , embezzlement or human rights violations.In addition , various countries have adopted laws and regulations , including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K . Bribery Act , related to corrupt and illegal payments to , and hiring practices with regard to , government officials and others . The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad , as well as subject to significant uncertainties that may be clarified only in the context of further regulatory guidance or enforcement proceedings.RJF and its affiliates have been required to implement and continuously maintain internal policies , procedures , and controls to meet the compliance obligations imposed by such U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations concerning anti-money laundering , economic sanctions , and anti-bribery and corruption . Failure to meet the requirements of these regulations can result in supervisory action , including fines.Privacy and data protectionU.S . federal law establishes minimum federal standards for financial privacy by , among other provisions , requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information . U.S. state law and regulations adopted under U.S. federal law impose obligations on RJF and its subsidiaries for protecting the confidentiality , integrity and availability of client information , and require notice of data breaches to certain U.S. regulators and to clients . The General Data Protection Regulation ( “ GDPR ” ) imposes additional requirements for companies that collect or store personal data of European Union residents . GDPR expands the scope of the E.U . data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of E.U . residents , imposes a strict data protection compliance regime , and includes new rights for E.U . residents . Similarly , the California Consumer Privacy Act , which was enacted in June 2018 and is scheduled to take effect on January 1 , 2020 , will impose privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents and require companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide for a number of new rights for California residents . We have adopted and disseminated privacy policies , and communicated required information relating to financial privacy and data security , in accordance with applicable law . We continue to monitor regulations related to data privacy and protection on both a domestic and international level to assess requirements and impacts on our global business operations , which could increase operational costs and result in significant financial penalties for failure to comply.Other non-U.S. regulationRaymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , including the Montreal Exchange and IIROC , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration , as well as by the SROs including IIROC . IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund , whose primary role is investor protection . This fund provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to 1 million Canadian dollars ( “ CAD ” ) per client , with separate coverage of CAD 1 million for certain types of accounts . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.13RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESCertain of our subsidiaries are registered in , and operate from , the U.K. which has a highly developed and comprehensive regulatory regime . Certain of these subsidiaries operate in the retail sector , providing investment and financial planning services to high-net-worth individuals , while others provide brokerage and investment banking services to institutional clients . These subsidiaries are authorized and regulated by the U.K. conduct regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority ( “ FCA ” ) , and have permission to carry out business in other E.U . countries as part of treaty arrangements . Certain of our other subsidiaries are incorporated and operate in France , providing investment and asset management services to high-net-worth individuals and brokerage services to institutional clients . These subsidiaries are both authorized and regulated by the French Regulatory Authority the L ’ Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution and Autorité des Marchés Financiers and have permission to carry out business in other E.U . countries as part of treaty arrangements . In Europe , the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( together , “ MiFID II ” ) , generally took effect on January 3 , 2018 , and introduced comprehensive , new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the E.U. , including new trading venues , enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency , and additional investor protection requirements , among others . We have made changes to our European operations , including systems and controls , in order to be in compliance with MiFID II.14RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives , business prospects , anticipated savings , financial results ( including expenses , earnings , liquidity , cash flow and capital expenditures ) , industry or market conditions , demand for and pricing of our products , acquisitions and divestitures , anticipated results of litigation , our effective tax rate , regulatory developments , effects of accounting pronouncements , and general economic conditions . In addition , words such as “ believes , ” “ expects , ” “ anticipates , ” “ intends , ” “ plans , ” “ estimates , ” “ projects , ” “ forecasts , ” and future or conditional verbs such 15RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESas “ will , ” “ may , ” “ could , ” “ should , ” and “ would , ” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events , are intended to identify forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees , and they involve risks , uncertainties and assumptions . Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable , there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements . We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” in this report . We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise.ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described in the following sections , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . The list of risk factors provided in the following sections is not exhaustive ; there may be factors not discussed in the following sections or of this Form 10-K that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , investors , financial advisors and other associates . If we fail to address , or appear to fail to address , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues may include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , record-keeping , and sales and trading practices . In addition , the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal , credit , liquidity and market risks inherent in our products could also give rise to reputational risk . Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards , or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and reputational harm . Negative publicity about us , whether or not true , may also harm our reputation.We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets.We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including economic output levels , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , prices of commodities , consumer confidence levels , international trade policy , and fiscal and monetary policy . For example , Fed policies determine , in large part , the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . Macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits.While we have experienced an operating environment that has been favorable for many of our businesses in recent years , if we were to experience a period of sustained downturn in the securities markets , a return to very low levels of short-term interest rates , credit market dislocations , reductions in the value of real estate , an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , and other negative market factors , our revenues could be significantly impaired . Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could lead to reduced profitability because certain of our expenses , including , but not limited to , our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited.U.S . markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in other parts of the world . Concerns about the E.U. , including the U.K. ’ s notice to the European Council of its decision to exit the E.U . ( “ Brexit ” ) and the stability of the E.U. ’ s sovereign debt , have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the future of the U.K. ’ s relationship with the E.U. , including timing of withdrawal , the nature of any transition , implementation or successor arrangements , and future trading arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U . In order to prepare for Brexit , we are taking steps to make certain changes to our European operations in an effort to ensure that we can continue to provide cross-border services in E.U . member states without the need for separate regulatory authorizations in each member state . There is also continued uncertainty regarding the outcome of the E.U. ’ s financial support programs . It is possible that other E.U . member states may experience financial troubles in the future , or may 16RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESchoose to follow the U.K. ’ s lead and leave the E.U . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity.We may be impacted by budget pressures affecting U.S. state and local governments , as well as negative trends in the housing and labor markets . Investor concerns regarding these trends could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce our fixed income investment banking revenues . In addition , such factors could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is affected primarily by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the U.S. and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; unemployment and under-employment rates ; real estate prices ; consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . Deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity or to easily access credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , such as limiting our recruiting of additional financial advisors , limiting lending , selling assets at unfavorable prices , and cutting or eliminating dividend payments . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by : the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings ; liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company ; limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries ; diminished access to the capital markets for RJF ; and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase our stock . Certain of our regulators have the authority , and under certain circumstances , the duty , to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent.The availability of financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on various factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their obligations to us due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers ’ market-making and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives as part of our trading operations . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in losses.We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by evaluating collateral and transaction levels on a recurring basis . Significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure.We permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults.17RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals , including through offering C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and other loans generally collateralized by securities . We also incur credit risk through our investments . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , or geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital.Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our securities . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy.See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.We are exposed to market risk , including interest rate risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread and an increase in fees received on our multi-bank deposit sweep program . Conversely , in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and private equity investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , foreign exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing our capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , if these companies go public and the size of our position relative to the public float , and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.A significant decline in our domestic client cash balances could negatively impact our net revenues and/or our ability to fund RJ Bank ’ s growth.We rely heavily on bank deposits to fund RJ Bank ’ s asset growth . The majority of RJ Bank ’ s deposits are primarily driven by the RJBDP , a multi-bank sweep program in which PCG clients ’ cash deposits in their accounts are swept into FDIC-insurance interest-bearing accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks . The RJBDP is a source of relatively low-cost , stable deposits . A significant 18RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESreduction in our domestic clients ’ cash balances , a change in the allocation of that cash between RJ Bank and third-party banks , or a transfer of cash away from the firm , could significantly impact the Bank ’ s ability to continue growing earnings assets and/or require the Bank to use higher-cost deposit sources to grow earnings assets.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts , and asset management fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual fund and annuity companies . The asset management fees we are paid are dependent upon the value of client assets in fee-based accounts in our PCG segment , as well as AUM in our Asset Management segment . The value of our fee-based assets and AUM is impacted by market fluctuations and inflows or outflows of assets . As a result of a shift by our PCG clients to fee-based accounts from traditional transaction-based accounts , a larger portion of our client assets are more directly impacted by market movements . Therefore , in periods of declining market values , the values of fee-based accounts and AUM may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our revenues . In addition , below-market investment performance by our funds , portfolio managers or financial advisors could result in reputational damage that might cause outflows or make it more difficult to attract new investors into our asset management products and thus further impact our business and financial condition . Our asset management fees may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts . In addition , the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products , which generate lower fees than actively managed products . A continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved . From time to time as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions , despite any risk mitigation policies , could impact our financial results.As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . Despite risk mitigation policies , we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market-making activities.We have made and , to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations , may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments ; however , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio . We may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we can not sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments . In addition , even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.Any cyber-attack or other security breach of our technology systems , or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on , could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing , storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial , personal and other information in our computer systems and networks . There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber-attacks involving the theft , dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets , in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties . Like other financial services firms , we experience malicious cyber activity directed at our computer systems , software , networks and its users on a daily basis . This malicious activity 19RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESincludes attempts at unauthorized access , implantation of computer viruses or malware , and denial-of-service attacks . We also experience large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against the firm , our associates , our advisors or our clients . We seek to continuously monitor for and nimbly react to any and all such activity , and we develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misuse , misappropriation or corruption.Cyber-attacks can originate from a variety of sources , including third parties affiliated with foreign governments , organized crime or terrorist organizations . Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . Although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches . However , the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls , including our cyber threat analytics , data encryption and tokenization technologies , anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management program , any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect , mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code , and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation , and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.We also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations , and we face similar risks relating to them . While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors , we can not be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach . In addition , in order to access our products and services , our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems.Notwithstanding the precautions we take , if a cyber-attack or other information security breach were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties , exposing us to liability . As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication , we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber-attacks to our customers . Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks , we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators . Additionally , the SEC issued guidance in February 2018 stating that , as a public company , we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity disclosure , and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws . Further , successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants , whether or not we are affected , could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us , including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general , which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services.Further , in light of the high volume of transactions we process , the large number of our clients , partners and counterparties , and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors , a cyber-attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack would take substantial amounts of time , and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information . During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.We may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws . In providing services to clients , we manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal , state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.20RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSee Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing operational risks.A continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business.Our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : ( i ) successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems on a regular basis ; ( ii ) maintain the quality of the information contained in our data processing and communications systems ; ( iii ) address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and ( iv ) retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , including a systems malfunction or cyber-attack , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management ” of this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing operational risks.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities and derivative transactions . As a result of regulatory changes and the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our market , credit , operational , liquidity and legal and regulatory compliance risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective . While we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not always anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value . A failure to manage our growth adequately , including growth in the products or services we offer , or to manage our risk effectively , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.Financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest , which are routinely examined by U.S. federal and state regulators and SROs such as FINRA and are often used as the basis for legal liability by plaintiffs in actions against us . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . Management of potential 21RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESconflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities . A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition.For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report.We continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.We continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , partially due to the industry trend toward the separate payment for research and execution services . Our trading margins have been further compressed by the use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive pressure . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.Recently , certain competitors have reduced or eliminated commissions for self-directed trading , and we expect that others may follow suit . This trend will impact certain transaction-related fees we charge in PCG , but at this time we do not expect the impact to be material.We face intense competition.We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , and location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry , which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section titled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors.We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . For example , recently several commercial firms and other non-traditional competitors have applied for banking licenses or have entered into partnerships with banks to provide banking services . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees , which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in 22RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESconnection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may work for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us . Certain of our competitors have withdrawn from the Protocol for Broker Recruiting ( “ Protocol ” ) , a voluntary agreement among over 1,800 firms that governs , among other things , the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm . The ability to bring such customer data to a new broker-dealer generally means that the financial advisor is better able to move client account balances to his or her new firm . It is possible that other competitors will similarly withdraw from the Protocol . If the broker-dealers from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent , or significantly limit , the transfer of client data , our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected and we could continue to experience claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts.A downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations , earnings and financial condition.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our client relationships . Such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability.We may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions . A credit rating downgrade would also result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on its $ 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility ( the “ Credit Facility ” ) , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information on the Credit Facility ) .Business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.We continue to grow , including through acquisitions and through our recruiting efforts . Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses , recruiting financial advisors , making strategic acquisitions or investments , or making investments in our control functions such as compliance and supervision . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.Moreover , to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms . We may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully . Difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise capital or borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition , which could result in dilution or increased leverage . We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all.23RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESAssociate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . Our employees interact with clients , customers and counterparties on an ongoing basis . All employees are expected to exhibit the behaviors and ethics that are reflected in our framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients . It is not possible to deter or prevent every instance of associate misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity will likely not be effective in all cases . If our associates improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to future regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over our assets under management . In addition , our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected.We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of liability . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations primarily involving claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability.In challenging market conditions , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . Litigation risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related to our investment recommendations , including the suitability of such recommendations or potential concentration of investments ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.See Item 3 “ Legal Proceedings ” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , derivatives , available-for-sale securities , certain loans and investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no directly observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods.24RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . The FASB has issued several new accounting standards in recent years , including on the topics of credit losses and leases , and the federal banking regulators have released implementation guidance and proposed implementation rules for some of these new standards . In particular , the new credit losses standard will replace multiple existing impairment models , including the replacement of the “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . We are evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of these standards and the proposed regulatory implementation rules will have on our financial position , results of operations as well as our regulatory capital . For further discussion of some of our significant accounting estimates , policies and standards , see Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates ” of this report and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . As previously discussed , weather events could also adversely impact certain loans within RJ Bank ’ s portfolio . Refer to Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our operational risk management.We are exposed to risks from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world and as a result , are exposed to risks , including market , litigation and regulatory compliance risks . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental or central bank policies , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from trading non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the previously mentioned factors.The expected phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest income and require significant operational work.The FCA , which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate ( “ LIBOR ” ) , has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021 . It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then . It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years . Although the full impact of transition remains unclear , this change may have an adverse impact on the value of , return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products , including any LIBOR-based securities , loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities . If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected , there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments . There will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems , processes and models . This may impact our existing transaction data , products , systems , operations , and valuation processes . The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest income and account and service fees . In addition , LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain assets . We are assessing the impact of the transition ; however , we can not reasonably estimate the impact of the transition at this time.25RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks . We have elected to self-insure our workers compensation , errors and omissions liability and our employee-related health care benefit plans . We have self-insured retention risk related to our property and casualty , and general liability benefit plans.While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , claims associated with risks we have retained either through our self-insurance retention or by self-insuring , may exceed our recorded reserves which could negatively impact future earnings . Insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms are highly regulated and the increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years may increase the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Over the last several years , financial services firms have been operating in an evolving regulatory environment . The industry has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry , as well as increased scrutiny from various regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . For example , the Dodd-Frank Act resulted in sweeping changes to the regulatory regime , including a significant increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry . Penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws , rules and regulations.Existing and new laws and regulations could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional compliance costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act , which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . Any action taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make such products and services less attractive , impose additional compliance measures , or result in fines , penalties or required remediation.We are also required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading , due to our underwriting and market-making activities and our investments in covered funds , we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased operational and compliance costs and changes to our private equity investments . Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies , procedures and practices.Broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to : sales and trading methods ; trade practices among broker-dealers ; use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities ; capital structure of securities firms ; anti-money laundering efforts ; recordkeeping ; and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business.The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . There is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by RJF and its subsidiaries . In addition , from time to time , RJF and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional findings with respect to supervisory , compliance or other regulatory deficiencies , which could subject 26RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESus to additional liability , including penalties , and restrictions on our business activities . Among other things , these restrictions could limit our ability to make investments , complete acquisitions , expand into new business lines , pay dividends and/or engage in share repurchases . See Item 1 “ Regulation ” of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” of this report regarding our approaches to managing compliance risk.Changes in requirements relating to the standard of conduct for broker-dealers applicable under federal and state law may adversely affect our businesses.In June 2019 , the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers , including Regulation Best Interest . Among other things , Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities . The regulation will impose heightened standards on broker-dealers and we anticipate incurring additional costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures , as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls . In addition to the SEC , various states have proposed , or are considering adopting , laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers that , as written , differ from the SEC ’ s new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs if adopted.Implementation of the new SEC regulations , as well as any new state rules that are adopted addressing similar matters , may negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance , legal , operations and information technology . Numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to our investment management activities may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.Investment management businesses have been affected by a number of highly publicized regulatory matters , which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors and broker-dealers . For example , the SEC initiated enforcement actions against a number of broker-dealers , including Raymond James , related to mutual fund share classes offered to their clients and fees paid for the distribution of mutual fund shares . As broker-dealers review and potentially make changes to the availability of mutual funds and mutual fund share classes available on their distribution platforms , such changes could affect our profitability.As some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in additional operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations or initiatives that have been or may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business , including our product and service offerings.In addition , U.S. and foreign governments have taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to do so including expanding current ( or enacting new ) standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , several states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees . Such “ pay-to-play ” rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business . The use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future . The research relied on in our investment management activities in the investment decision-making process is typically generated internally by our investment analysts or external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research is generally used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third-party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these additional costs.New regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products , including additional recordkeeping and disclosure requirements , may impact our asset management business and result in increased costs.27RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the U.S. and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items , as calculated under regulatory guidelines . The capital amounts and classification for both RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by U.S. federal regulators based on components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets , Tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory ( and potentially additional discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and financial condition.We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds . In addition , our Canada-based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by IIROC . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that RJF needs to make payments on any of its obligations.See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.The Basel III regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our profitability.The Fed , the OCC and the FDIC have implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The U.S. Basel III Rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . We became subject to the requirements under the final U.S. Basel III Rules as of January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The increased capital requirements stipulated under the U.S. Basel III Rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.As a financial holding company , RJF ’ s liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries , which may be subject to regulatory restrictions.RJF is a financial holding company and therefore depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations , including its debt service obligations . RJF ’ s subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to RJF . RJF ’ s broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses . These requirements may hinder RJF ’ s ability to access funds from its subsidiaries . RJF may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock . The federal banking regulators , including the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC , as well as the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority and under certain circumstances , the obligation , to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise , including RJF and its bank subsidiaries . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources ” of this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . An unfavorable CRA rating or a successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required 28RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESpayment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , and the imposition of restrictions on mergers , acquisitions and expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.CRA regulations are currently being evaluated by regulators . Any revisions to the regulations that implement the CRA may negatively impact our business , including through increased costs related to compliance.ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable."

( “ RJF , ” the “ firm ” or the “ Company ” ) is a leading diversified financial services company providing private client group , capital markets , asset management , banking and other services to individuals , corporations and municipalities . The firm , together with its subsidiaries , is engaged in various financial services activities , including providing investment management services for retail and institutional clients , the underwriting , distribution , trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products . The firm also provides corporate and retail banking services , and trust services.Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) under the symbol “ RJF. ” As a bank holding company and financial holding company , RJF is subject to supervision , examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) .Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , advisors , associates and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through five segments . Our business segments are Private Client Group ( “ PCG ” ) , Capital Markets , Asset Management and Raymond James Bank , N.A . ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . Our Other segment captures private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to our business segments.The following graph depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our business segments for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2018 . *The preceding chart does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.PRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide financial planning and securities transaction services through branch office systems . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice . Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting , transitional cost assistance and retention purposes.Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as of September 30 , 2018 were to $ 755.7 billion . We had 7,813 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2018 . 3RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESEmployee financial advisorsEmployee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to individual clients . These financial advisors are our employees , and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans.Independent contractor financial advisorsOur financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , receive a higher payout percentage than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , they are permitted to conduct , on a limited basis , certain other approved business activities , such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services.Irrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third-party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues from this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration , and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature . Recurring revenues include asset-based fees , trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products , mutual fund and annuity service fees , fees earned on our multi-bank sweep program and interest . The proportion of our securities commissions and fees revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced.Securities commissions and fees revenues by affiliation , as well as the portion of segment net revenues that was recurring versus transactional in nature , for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2018 , are presented in the following graphs . 4RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) -insured deposit accounts , including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of securities , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.As of September 30 , 2018 , corporate and tax-exempt loans represented approximately 65 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , of which 89 % were U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of agency MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations ( “ CMOs ” ) and is classified as available-for-sale . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients.RJ Bank had total assets of $ 22.92 billion at September 30 , 2018 , which are detailed in the following graph.7RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOTHEROur Other segment includes our private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF , such as the interest cost on our public debt and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions ( See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( “ Form 10-K ” ) for additional information on our acquisitions ) .Our private equity activities include various direct and third-party private equity investments and various private equity funds which we sponsor . EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORSOur employees and independent contractors ( collectively “ associates ” ) are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As of September 30 , 2018 , we had approximately 13,900 employees and approximately 4,650 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel at various locations who are responsible for processing securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , the receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our securities brokerage operations . The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our businesses . This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients . We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and Company information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . Our business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a full time staff devoted to maintaining those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida , one of our operations processing or data center sites ( located in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee or Michigan ) as well as our branch and office locations throughout the U.S. , Canada and Europe.COMPETITIONThe financial services industry is intensely competitive . We compete with many other financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , services , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.Our ability to compete effectively is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONRJF is a bank holding company ( “ BHC ” ) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 , as amended ( the “ BHC Act ” ) that has made an election to be a financial holding company ( “ FHC ” ) . Under the BHC Act , the activities of BHCs and FHCs are limited generally to those activities closely related to banking and with respect to FHCs , activities financial in nature as outlined in the BHC Act and related regulations . For RJF to remain a FHC , it and its depository institution subsidiaries must remain “ well capitalized ” and “ well managed ” in accordance with the standards of the Fed and , with respect to its depository institution subsidiaries , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) . As a FHC , RJF is subject to regulation , oversight , and consolidated supervision , including periodic examination , by the Fed . Under existing regulation , the Fed has authority to examine and take action with respect to all of our subsidiaries . RJ Bank is a national bank and insured depository regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC and the Consumer 8RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFinancial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our trust company subsidiary also is regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC . The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and RJ Trust . Collectively , the rules and regulations of the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business , including , for example , lending practices , the receipt of deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , conduct and qualifications of personnel and , as discussed further below , capital requirements . This regulatory , supervisory and oversight framework is subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF , RJ Bank and RJ Trust . As a part of their supervisory functions , the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC , and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and , in the case of the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC , for unsafe or unsound practices . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries , which are also registered investment advisors , are subject to regulation and oversight by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities discussed under “ Other regulations applicable to our operations ” below.The following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to RJF . The framework is intended to protect our clients , the integrity of the financial markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders . These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities , as well as our ability to submit funds to RJF from our regulated subsidiaries , which include RJ Bank and our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced . A change in applicable statutes or regulations or in regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.Rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank ActSince 2010 , the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) has imposed significant new regulatory and compliance requirements , although some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years.As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations , we continue to experience a period of notable change in financial regulation and supervision . These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business . Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux and may be subject to amendment in the near future , particularly due to the President ’ s executive order issued in February 2017 to evaluate the current regulatory framework , particularly as it relates to the financial services industry . As a result , we can not specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations ( see Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . In the following sections , we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related measures.FDIC assessment ratesSince RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . For banks with greater than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s current assessment rate calculation relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress , in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail.CFPB oversightThe CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under several consumer protection laws , including the : ( i ) Equal Credit Opportunity Act ; ( ii ) Truth in Lending Act ; ( iii ) Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ; ( iv ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ; ( v ) Fair Debt Collection Act ; ( vi ) Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and ( vii ) unfair , deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act . Since the beginning of fiscal year 2014 , the CFPB has had supervisory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB also has authority to promulgate regulations , issue orders , draft policy statements , conduct examinations , and bring enforcement actions . The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws . To the extent that , as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight , we become the subject of any enforcement activity , we may be required to pay fines , incur penalties , or engage in certain remediation efforts.Stress testsOn May 24 , 2018 , the Economic Growth , Regulatory Relief , and Consumer Protection Act ( the “ EGRRCPA ” ) was signed into law , making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act , as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations . Among other things , the law raises the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing , liquidity coverage and living will requirements for bank holding companies to $ 250 billion , subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements 9RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESto institutions with assets of $ 100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns . On July 6 , 2018 , the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA . As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA , RJF and RJ Bank are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements . The Volcker RuleRJF is subject to the Volcker Rule , a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act , which generally prohibits , subject to exceptions , insured depository institutions , bank holding companies and their affiliates ( together , “ banking entities ” ) from engaging in proprietary trading and limits investments in and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds ( “ covered funds ” ) . Banking entities must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program . We have adopted a program , which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule ; however , in connection with their examinations , regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program . We maintain a number of private equity investments , some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule . The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in covered funds was July 2017 ; however , banking entities were able to apply for an extension to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain illiquid funds . The majority of our covered fund investments meet the criteria to be considered an illiquid fund under the Volcker Rule and we received approval from the Fed to continue to hold such investments until July 2022 . The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and to execute appropriate strategies to comply with the Volcker Rule at such time . However , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio.On June 5 , 2018 , the five federal regulatory agencies having oversight over the Volcker Rule announced publication of proposed amendments to the rule . The notice of proposed rulemaking contains certain revisions to the Volcker Rule ’ s covered fund restrictions . RJF is evaluating the proposal to determine the impact such proposal will have , if any , if it becomes effective.Basel III and U.S. Capital RulesBoth RJF and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to regulatory actions in recent years . In July 2013 , the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC released final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums ( the “ U.S . Basel III Rules ” ) . The U.S. Basel III Rules : ( i ) increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital ; ( ii ) establish a capital conservation buffer ; and ( iii ) make changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1 , 2015 , subject to applicable phase-in periods . The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank as of January 1 , 2016 , subject to applicable phase-in periods . See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information regarding RJF and RJ Bank regulatory capital levels and ratios , including information regarding the capital conservation buffer . The increased capital requirements could restrict our abilities to grow during favorable market conditions and to return capital to shareholders , or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” within this report for more information.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary , and in certain cases , mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of : ( i ) Common Equity Tier 1 ( or “ CET1 ” ) , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ; ( ii ) Tier 1 capital to average assets ; and ( iii ) capital conservation buffers . See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.Fiduciary duty standardIn April 2016 , the U.S. Department of Labor ( the “ DOL ” ) issued a final regulation ( the “ DOL Rule ” ) expanding the definition of who is deemed an “ investment advice fiduciary ” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , as amended ( “ ERISA ” ) , as a result of giving investment advice to a “ plan , ” “ plan participant ” or “ beneficiary , ” as well as under the Internal Revenue Code for individual retirement arrangements ( “ IRAs ” ) and non-ERISA plans ( collectively , “ qualified plans ” ) . However , in June 2018 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the DOL Rule , and thus it is no longer in effect.10RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSeparately , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . In April 2018 , the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest . The proposed Regulation Best Interest would , among other things , require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer . We anticipate the adoption of any new rule by the SEC will require us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities , which may lead to additional costs . In addition , state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring , as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures.Holding company supportUnder the Dodd-Frank Act , the Fed must require that bank holding companies , such as RJF , serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution . The term “ source of financial strength ” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries . Under this requirement , RJF in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to RJ Bank should it experience financial distress.Incentive-based compensation arrangementsPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions . The agencies released a proposed rule in 2016 that , if implemented , would prohibit certain forms of incentive-based compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than $ 1 billion in total assets ( the “ Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal ” ) . No final rule has been issued to date . Other regulations applicable to our operationsThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the U.S. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations , including sales and trading practices , public offerings , publication of research reports , use and safekeeping of client funds and securities , capital structure , record-keeping , privacy requirements , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states.Broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others , and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form . These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates . The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules , many of which became effective as of October 2013 and are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries , including changes to the : ( i ) net capital rule ; ( ii ) customer protection rule ; ( iii ) record-keeping rules ; and ( iv ) notification rules.Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the U.S. , we have additional offices primarily in Canada and Europe and are subject to regulations in those areas . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) ( i.e. , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges ) . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities regulators may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act ( “ SIPA ” ) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under SIPA , and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended ( the “ Investment Advisers Act ” ) , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our asset 11RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESmanagement business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ( the “ CRA ” ) . The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating . Members of the public may submit comments on a bank ’ s performance under the CRA and such comments will form part of the bank ’ s performance evaluation . The results of the evaluation , together with the bank ’ s CRA rating , are also taken into consideration when evaluating mergers , acquisitions , and applications to open a branch or facility . RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA . In August 2018 , the OCC requested comment on ways to modernize its regulations that implement the CRA , which could affect how the CRA is applied to RJ Bank , but no proposed regulations have been issued at this time.U.S . federal law establishes minimum federal standards for financial privacy by , among other provisions , requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information . U.S. state law and regulations adopted under U.S. federal law impose obligations on RJF and its subsidiaries for protecting the security , confidentiality and integrity of client information , and require notice of data breaches to certain U.S. regulators , and in some cases , to clients . The General Data Protection Regulation ( “ GDPR ” ) imposes additional requirements for companies that collect or store personal data of European Union residents . GDPR expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents , imposes a strict data protection compliance regime , and includes new rights . RJF has adopted and disseminated privacy policies , and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security , in accordance with applicable law.Raymond James Limited ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , including the Montreal Exchange and IIROC , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration , as well as by the SROs including IIROC . IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( the “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to 1 million Canadian dollars ( “ CAD ” ) per client , with separate coverage of CAD 1 million for certain types of accounts . See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.In Europe , the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( together , “ MiFID II ” ) , generally took effect on January 3 , 2018 , and introduced comprehensive , new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the European Union , including new trading venues , enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency , and additional investor protection requirements , among others . We have made changes to our European operations , including systems and controls , in order to be in compliance with MiFID II.Central banks around the world , including the Fed , have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate ( “ LIBOR ” ) based on observable market transactions . It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years . Although the full impact of a transition , including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication , remains unclear , this change may have an adverse impact on the value of , return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products , including any LIBOR-based securities , loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities . A transition away from LIBOR may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products , as well as our systems and processes.Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( “ Patriot Act ” ) and requirements administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( “ FinCEN ” ) require financial institutions , among other things , to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism , including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting , compliance , record-keeping and initial and on-going due diligence on customers . The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government , including : due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts ; standards for obtaining and verifying 12RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIEScustomer identification at account opening ; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions , regulators , and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism , money laundering and other crimes . In May 2016 , FinCEN issued a new rule that , since May 2018 , has required certain financial institutions , including our U.S. bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries , to obtain certain beneficial ownership information from legal entity clients . Failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act , the Patriot Act or FinCEN can lead to supervisory actions including fines.13RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESADDITIONAL INFORMATIONOur Internet address is www.raymondjames.com . We make available on our website , free of charge and in printer-friendly format including “ .pdf ” file extensions , our Annual Reports on Form 10-K , Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q , Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 ( a ) or 15 ( d ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with , or furnish it to , the SEC.Factors affecting “ forward-looking statements ” Certain statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute “ forward-looking statements ” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives , business prospects , anticipated savings , financial results ( including expenses , earnings , liquidity , cash flow and capital expenditures ) , industry or market conditions , demand for and pricing of our products , acquisitions and divestitures , anticipated results of litigation , changes in tax rules and our effective tax rate , regulatory developments , effects of accounting pronouncements , and general economic conditions . In addition , words such as “ believes , ” “ expects , ” “ anticipates , ” “ intends , ” “ plans , ” “ estimates , ” “ projects , ” “ forecasts , ” and future or conditional verbs such as “ will , ” “ may , ” “ could , ” “ should , ” and “ would , ” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events , are intended to identify forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees , and they involve risks , uncertainties and assumptions . Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable , there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements . We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” in this report . We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise.ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . The list of risk factors provided in the following sections is not exhaustive ; there may be factors not discussed in the following sections or in this Form 10-K that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , investors and associates . If we fail to address , or appear to fail to address , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues may include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , record-keeping , and sales and trading practices , the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards , or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and reputational harm . Negative publicity about us , whether or not true , may also harm our future business prospects.We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including economic output levels , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , prices of commodities , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . For example , Fed policies determine , in large part , the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . Macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits.15RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWhile we have recently experienced an operating environment that has been favorable for many of our businesses , at times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions . If we were to experience a period of sustained downturns in the securities markets , a return to very low levels of short-term interest rates , credit market dislocations , reductions in the value of real estate , an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , and other negative market factors , our revenues could be significantly impaired . Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could lead to reduced profitability because certain of our expenses , including , but not limited to , our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited.U.S . markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in other parts of the world . Concerns about the European Union ( “ EU ” ) , including Britain ’ s notice to the European Council of its decision to exit the EU ( “ Brexit ” ) and the stability of the EU ’ s sovereign debt , have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the EU ’ s financial support programs . It is possible that other EU member states may experience financial troubles in the future , or may choose to follow Britain ’ s lead and leave the EU . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity.We may be impacted by budget pressures affecting U.S. state and local governments , as well as negative trends in the housing and labor markets . Investor concerns regarding these trends could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce our fixed income investment banking revenues . In addition , such factors could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is affected primarily by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the U.S. and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; unemployment and under-employment rates ; real estate prices ; consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . Deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.We must maintain appropriate liquidity levels . Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at unfavorable prices , and cutting or eliminating dividend payments . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , regulatory changes to the liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets for RJF , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase our stock . Certain of our regulators have the authority , and under certain circumstances , the duty , to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent.The availability of financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on various factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers ’ market-making and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives as part of our trading inventory . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses.16RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . Significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure.We permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults.We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of loans , including C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and other loans collateralized by securities . We also incur credit risk through our investments . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , or geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital.Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our securities . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy.See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread and an increase in fees received on our multi-bank deposit sweep program . Conversely , in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and private equity investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , foreign exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing our capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.17RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESOur private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts , and advisory fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts . In addition , the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products , which generate lower fees than actively managed products . A continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) . AUM balances are impacted by net inflows/outflows of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our values of AUM may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , despite risk mitigation policies , we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market-making or underwriting activities.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and , to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations , may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments ; however , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio . We may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we can not sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.Any cyber-attack or other security breach of our technology systems , or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on , could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing , storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial , personal and other information in our computer systems and networks . There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber-attacks involving the theft , dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets , in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties . Like other financial services firms , we are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks , including unauthorized access , mishandling or misuse of information , computer viruses or malware , denial-of-service attacks , phishing or other forms of social engineering , and other events , and we seek to continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption . Cyber-attacks can 18RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESoriginate from a variety of sources , including third parties affiliated with foreign governments , organized crime or terrorist organizations . Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . Although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches . However , the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls , including our cyber threat analytics , data encryption and tokenization technologies , anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management program , any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect , mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code , and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation , and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.We also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations , and we face similar risks relating to them . While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors , we can not be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach . In addition , in order to access our products and services , our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems.Notwithstanding the precautions we take , if a cyber-attack or other information security breach were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties , exposing us to liability . As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication , we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber-attacks to our customers . Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks , we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators . Additionally , the SEC issued guidance in February 2018 stating that , as a public company , we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity disclosure , and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws . Further , successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants , whether or not we are affected , could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us , including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general , which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services.Further , in light of the high volume of transactions we process , the large number of our clients , partners and counterparties , and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors , a cyber-attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack would take substantial amounts of time , and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information . During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.We may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws . In providing services to clients , we manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal , state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.19RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESA continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business.Our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : ( i ) successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ; ( ii ) address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and ( iii ) retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management ” of this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our market , credit , operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective . While we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value . A failure to manage our growth adequately , including growth in the products or services we offer , or to manage our risk effectively , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.Financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest , which are under growing scrutiny by U.S. federal and state regulators and SROs such as FINRA . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities . A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition.For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” in this report.20RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.We continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , partially due to the industry trend toward unbundling fees related to research and execution . Our trading margins have been further compressed by the use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive pressure . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , and location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry , which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors.We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , and the members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees , which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may work for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us . Certain large broker-dealer competitors have withdrawn from the Protocol for Broker Recruiting ( “ Protocol ” ) , a voluntary agreement among over 1,700 firms that governs , among other things , the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm . The ability to bring such customer 21RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESdata to a new broker-dealer generally means that the financial advisor is better able to move client account balances to his or her new firm . It is possible that other competitors will similarly withdraw from the Protocol . If the broker-dealers from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent , or significantly limit , the transfer of client data , our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected and we could experience a higher number of claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts.A downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations , earnings and financial condition.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our client relationships . Such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability.We may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions . A credit rating downgrade would also result in RJF incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its $ 300 million revolving credit facility ( the “ RJF Credit Facility ” ) , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for information on the RJF Credit Facility ) .Business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.We continue to grow , including through acquisitions and through our recruiting efforts . Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses , recruiting financial advisors , or making strategic acquisitions or investments . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.Moreover , to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms . We may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully . Difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise capital or borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition , which could result in dilution or increased leverage . We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all.Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . If our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business . In addition , our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected.We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized 22RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESor illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability . Our PCG business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses.In challenging market conditions , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . Litigation risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related to the suitability of our investment recommendations ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.See Item 3 “ Legal Proceedings ” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters and see Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” of this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.A significant decline in our domestic client cash balances could negatively impact our net revenues and/or our ability to fund RJ Bank ’ s growth.We rely heavily on bank deposits as a low-cost source of funding for RJ Bank to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities . Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our multi-bank sweep program in which clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into FDIC-insured interest-bearing accounts at RJ Bank and various third-party banks . A significant reduction in our domestic clients ’ cash balances , a change in the allocation of that cash between RJ Bank and third-party banks , or a transfer of cash away from RJF , could impact our net revenues and our ability to fund RJ Bank ’ s growth.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates ” of this report for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available-for-sale securities , certain loans , and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no directly observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see Item 7 “ Management ’ s 23RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical accounting estimates ” of this report , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.The FASB has issued several new accounting standards , including on the topics of credit losses and leases and the Federal banking regulators have released implementation guidance and proposed implementation rules for some of these new standards . In particular , the new credit losses standard will replace multiple existing impairment models , including the replacement of the “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . We are evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of these standards and the proposed regulatory implementation rules will have on our financial position , results of operations as well as our regulatory capital . See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . As previously discussed , weather events could also adversely impact certain loans within RJ Bank ’ s portfolio . Refer to Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our operational risk management.We are exposed to risks from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world and as a result , are exposed to risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental or central bank policies , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from trading non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above-mentioned factors.We are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks . We have elected to self-insure our workers compensation , errors and omissions liability and our employee-related health care benefit plans . We have self-insured retention risk related to our property and casualty , and general liability benefit plans.While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , claims associated with risks we have retained either through our self-insurance retention or by self-insuring , may exceed our recorded reserves which could negatively impact future earnings . Insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms have been subject to regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years , increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Financial services firms over the last several years have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment . The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from various regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . Penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws , rules and regulations.The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry ( see Item 1 “ Regulation , ” of this report for a discussion of such changes ) . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations , as further modified by the EGRRCPA and other financial services legislation , will have on us and the financial 24RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESservices industry more broadly can not be quantified until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented . Nevertheless , it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional compliance costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations , and interact with regulators , all of which could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have impacted or may impact our businesses include : the establishment of a uniform fiduciary standard or a best interest standard for broker-dealers ; regulatory oversight of incentive compensation ; the imposition of increased capital requirements on financial holding companies ; prohibition of proprietary trading ; restrictions on investments in covered funds ; and , to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act , which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . The CFPB has had an active enforcement agenda and any action taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make such products and services less attractive , impose additional compliance measures , or result in fines , penalties or required remediation . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us . We are also required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading , due to our underwriting and market-making activities and our investments in covered funds , we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased operational and compliance costs and changes to our private equity investments . Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies , procedures and practices.Broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to : sales and trading methods ; trade practices among broker-dealers ; use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities ; capital structure of securities firms ; anti-money laundering efforts ; recordkeeping ; and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business.The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . There is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by RJF and its subsidiaries . In addition , from time to time , RJF and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional findings with respect to supervisory , compliance or other regulatory deficiencies , which could subject us to additional liability , including penalties , and restrictions on our business activities . Among other things , these restrictions could limit our ability to make investments , complete acquisitions , expand into new business lines , pay dividends and/or engage in share repurchases . See Item 1 “ Regulation ” of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk management ” of this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk.Changes in requirements relating to the standard of conduct for broker-dealers applicable under state law may adversely affect our businesses.In April 2016 , the DOL issued its final rule defining the term “ fiduciary ” and related exemptions in the context of ERISA and retirement accounts . On June 21 , 2018 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court issued an order vacating the DOL Rule and related exemptions . We dedicated significant resources to interpret and implement policies to comply with the DOL Rule and continue to evaluate the solutions available to retirement accounts , with additional changes possible . While the overall impact of the recently vacated DOL Rule may have ultimately been adverse to our financial condition , results of operations and liquidity , we may benefit from the changes to systems , processes , and offerings completed for the DOL Rule in complying with forthcoming regulatory initiatives.In April 2018 , the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest , which would require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer . 25RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe anticipate that if a rule imposing heightened standards on broker-dealers is adopted by the SEC or fiduciary rules are adopted at the state level , we will be required to incur costs in order to review and possibly modify the compliance plan and approach that we had previously implemented for the now-vacated DOL Rule . Implementation of any rules addressing similar matters may negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance , legal and information technology.Numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to the asset management business may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The staff of the SEC ’ s Office of Compliance , Inspections and Examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to sub-transfer agents and sub-administrators for services that may be deemed to be distribution-related . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , their impact can not be fully ascertained at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results.Asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries , which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors and broker-dealers . As some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in additional operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations or initiatives that have been or may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business , including our product and service offerings.In addition , U.S. and foreign governments have taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to do so including expanding current ( or enacting new ) standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , several states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees . Such “ pay-to-play ” rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business . The use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future . A substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision-making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research is generally used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third-party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these additional costs.New regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products , including additional recordkeeping and disclosure requirements , may impact our asset management business and result in increased costs.Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the U.S. and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items , as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for both RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by U.S. federal regulators based on components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets , Tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory ( and potentially additional discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and financial condition.We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds . In addition , our Canada-based 26RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESbroker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by IIROC . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that RJF needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.The Basel III regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our profitability.In July 2013 , the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III Rules , which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The U.S. Basel III Rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . We became subject to the requirements under the final U.S. Basel III Rules as of January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The increased capital requirements stipulated under the U.S. Basel III Rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.As a financial holding company , RJF ’ s liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries , which may be subject to regulatory restrictions.RJF is a financial holding company and therefore depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations , including its debt service obligations . RJF ’ s subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to RJF . RJF ’ s broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in broker or bank accounts to fund their businesses . These requirements may hinder RJF ’ s ability to access funds from its subsidiaries . RJF may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock . The federal banking regulators , including the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC , as well as the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority and under certain circumstances , the obligation , to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise , including RJF and its bank subsidiaries . See Item 7 “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and capital resources ” of this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . An unfavorable CRA rating or a successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , and the imposition of restrictions on mergers , acquisitions and expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.The OCC has requested comment on ways to modernize the regulations that implement the CRA for national banks , such as RJ Bank . Any revisions to the regulations that implement the CRA may negatively impact our business , including through increased costs related to compliance.ITEM 1B .

RJF and its subsidiaries also provide investment management services for retail and institutional clients , corporate and retail banking services , and trust services . Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) under the symbol “ RJF. ” As a bank holding company and financial holding company , RJF is subject to supervision , examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) .

( “ RJFSA ” ) , Raymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) , Eagle Asset Management , Inc. ( “ Eagle ” ) , and Raymond James Bank , N.A . ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF . RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “ the firm ” , “ our , ” “ we , ” or “ us. ” Our operations are predominately conducted in the United States of America ( “ U.S. ” ) and Canada . Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , advisors , associates and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through four operating segments and our Other segment . The four operating segments are Private Client Group ( “ PCG ” ) , Capital Markets , Asset Management , and RJ Bank . The Other segment captures private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF . The graph below depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our operating segments for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2017 : *Chart above does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.3RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESPRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide financial planning and securities transaction services through branch office systems . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice . Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain other key revenue producers , primarily for transitional cost assistance and retention purposes.Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as of September 30 , 2017 amount to $ 659.5 billion . We have 7,346 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2017 . Employee Financial AdvisorsEmployee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to individual clients . These financial advisors are our employees , and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans . Independent Contractor Financial AdvisorsOur financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , they are permitted to conduct , on a limited basis , certain other approved business activities , such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services . Irrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues from this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration , and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature . Recurring revenues include asset-based fees , trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products , mutual fund and annuity service fees , fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program , and interest . The proportion of our securities commissions and fee revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced . Securities commissions and fee revenues by affiliation , as well as the portion of segment net revenues that was recurring versus transactional in nature , for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2017 , are presented below : 4RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESWe earn investment advisory and related administrative fees on both managed and non-discretionary asset-based accounts . In managed programs , decisions are made by in-house or third-party portfolio managers or investment committees about how to invest the assets in accordance with such programs ’ objectives . In non-discretionary asset-based programs , we provide administrative support , which may include trade execution , record-keeping and periodic investor reporting . We generally earn higher fees for managed programs than for non-discretionary asset-based programs , since we provide additional services to managed programs . As of September 30 , 2017 , there were $ 96.4 billion in financial assets held in managed programs and $ 157.0 billion in financial assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs . The graph below depicts financial assets under management in our managed programs by objective as of September 30 , 2017 : RJ BANKRJ Bank provides corporate ( commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) , commercial real estate ( “ CRE ” ) and CRE construction ) , securities-based ( “ SBL ” ) , tax-exempt and residential loans . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . RJ Bank operates primarily from a branch location adjacent to RJF ’ s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank ’ s products and services is available through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include C & I loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , tax-exempt loans , as well as loans fully collateralized by marketable securities . Corporate and tax-exempt loans represent approximately 67 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , of which 90 % are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of agency MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations ( “ CMOs ” ) and is classified as available-for-sale . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients . 7RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRJ Bank had total assets of $ 20.61 billion at September 30 , 2017 , which were comprised of the following : OTHEROur Other segment includes our private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF , such as the interest cost on our senior notes payable , and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions ( See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( “ Form 10-K ” ) for additional information on our acquisitions ) . Our private equity activities include various direct and third party private equity investments and various private equity funds which we sponsor . EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORSOur employees and independent contractors ( collectively “ associates ” ) are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As of September 30 , 2017 , we had over 12,700 employees and over 4,300 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel at various locations throughout the U.S. who are responsible for processing securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , the receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations . RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver , British Columbia.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our businesses . This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their businesses.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients . We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and Company information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . Our business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a staff which devotes its full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and 8RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIEStested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida or one of our operations processing or data center sites in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee or Michigan.We have also developed a business continuity plan for each of our PCG retail branches in the event any of these branches is impacted by severe weather . COMPETITIONThe financial services industry is an intensely competitive business . We compete with many other financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , services , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONRJF is a bank holding company subject to the Bank Holding Company Act that has made an election to be a financial holding company . As a financial holding company , RJF is subject to regulation , oversight , and supervision , including periodic examination , by the Fed . RJ Bank is a national bank regulated , supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our trust company subsidiary also is regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC . The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and the trust company . Collectively , the rules and regulations of the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business , including , for example , lending practices , the receipt of deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , conduct and qualifications of personnel and , as discussed further below , capital requirements . This regulatory , supervisory and oversight framework is subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF , RJ Bank and the trust company . As a part of their supervisory functions , the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC , and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and , in the case of the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC , for unsafe or unsound practices . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries , which are also registered investment advisors , are subject to regulation and oversight by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities discussed under “ Other regulations applicable to our operations ” below.The following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to RJF . The framework is intended to protect our clients , the integrity of the financial markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders . These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities , as well as our ability to submit funds to RJF from our regulated subsidiaries , which include RJ Bank and our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced . A change in applicable statutes or regulations or in regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.Rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank ActIn July 2010 , the U.S. government enacted sweeping changes to the supervision and regulation of the financial industry through the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( the “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . The Dodd-Frank Act required U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings , studies and reports . These regulatory agencies include : the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ; the Securities and Exchange Commission ( the “ SEC ” ) ; the Fed ; the OCC ; the FDIC ; the CFPB ; and the Financial Stability Oversight Council . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately ; however , the details of some provisions are subject to implementing regulations . Furthermore , some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years . As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms , we are experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and supervision . These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business . Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux and may be subject to amendment in the near future . As a result , we can not specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations ( see Item 1A , “ Risk 9RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFactors , ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . Below , we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related measures.FDIC Assessment RatesSince RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . In February 2011 , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base . For banks with greater than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation , which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail . CFPB OversightIn July 2011 , the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws applicable to all banks and was provided broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under several consumer protection laws , including the : ( i ) Equal Credit Opportunity Act ; ( ii ) Truth in Lending Act ; ( iii ) Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ; ( iv ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ; ( v ) Fair Debt Collection Act ; ( vi ) Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and unfair , deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act . Beginning with fiscal year 2014 , the CFPB assumed supervisory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations , issue orders , draft policy statements , conduct examinations , and bring enforcement actions . The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws . To the extent that , as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight , we become the subject of any enforcement activity , we may be required to pay fines , incur penalties , or engage in certain remediation efforts.Stress TestsIn October 2012 , the Fed , FDIC and OCC jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies , state member banks , and savings and loan companies with total assets between $ 10 billion and $ 50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests , report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed ( RJF ’ s primary regulator ) , and publish a summary of the results . Stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios ( baseline , adverse , and severely adverse ) prescribed by the Fed . A summary of certain of our stress test results ( RJF and RJ Bank ) is available on our website at www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-report under “ Other Reports and Information - 2017 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Disclosure ” ( the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report ) .The Volcker RuleRJF is subject to the Volcker Rule , a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act which generally prohibits , subject to exceptions , insured depository institutions , bank holding companies and their affiliates ( together , “ banking entities ” ) from engaging in proprietary trading and limits investments in and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds ( “ covered funds ” ) . Banking entities must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program . We have adopted a program , which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule ; however , in connection with their examinations , regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program . We maintain a number of private equity investments , some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule . The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in covered funds was July 2017 ; however , banking entities were able to apply for an extension to provide up to an additional five years to conform investments in certain illiquid funds . The majority of our covered fund investments meet the criteria to be considered an illiquid fund under the Volcker Rule and we received approval from the Fed to continue to hold such investments until July 2022 . The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and to execute appropriate strategies to comply with the Volcker Rule at such time . Our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio . Basel III and U.S. Capital RulesBoth RJF , as a bank holding company , and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to regulatory actions in recent years . In July 2013 , the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC released final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums ( the “ U.S . Basel III Rules ” ) . The U.S. Basel III Rules : ( i ) increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital ; ( ii ) establish a capital conservation buffer ; and ( iii ) make changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1 , 2015 , subject to applicable 10RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESphase-in periods . The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank as of January 1 , 2016 . See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding RJF and RJ Bank regulatory capital levels and ratios , including information regarding the capital conservation buffer . The increased capital requirements could restrict our abilities to grow during favorable market conditions and to return capital to shareholders , or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for more information.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary , and in certain cases , mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of : ( i ) Common Equity Tier 1 ( or “ CET1 ” ) , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ; ( ii ) Tier 1 capital to average assets ; and ( iii ) capital conservation buffers . See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K , for further information.Money Market ReformIn July 2014 , the SEC adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds . The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds , while preserving the benefits of the funds . We do not sponsor any money market funds . We utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes as well as to offer our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternatives.Municipal Advisor RegulationIn 2013 as required under the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC issued its final rule regarding the new category of regulated financial activity : “ municipal advisors ” ( the “ MA Rule ” ) . The MA Rule , which became effective in 2014 : ( i ) imposes a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities ; ( ii ) may result in the need for new written representations by issuers ; and ( iii ) may limit the manner in which we , in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles , interact with municipal issuers . In addition to the SEC rule , the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ( “ MSRB ” ) has developed a number of implementing rules and interpretive guidance relating to municipal advisors , and we have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with such rules and guidance.While over these past few years , broker-dealer and municipal advisor interaction with municipal entities has become an area of greater rulemaking and regulatory exam and enforcement interest , we do not expect a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations , which are included in our Capital Markets segment.Fiduciary Duty StandardPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . The SEC has stated that it will consider a heightened standard of care ; however , to date , it has not yet proposed any rules . In April 2016 , the U.S. Department of Labor ( the “ DOL ” ) issued its final regulation ( the “ DOL Rule ” ) expanding the definition of who is deemed an “ investment advice fiduciary ” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , as amended ( “ ERISA ” ) , as a result of giving investment advice to a “ plan , ” “ plan participant ” or “ beneficiary , ” as well as under the Internal Revenue Code for individual retirement arrangements ( “ IRAs ” ) and non-ERISA plans ( collectively , “ qualified plans ” ) . As a result of adopting a new definition of “ fiduciary ” under ERISA , the final rule extends fiduciary status to many investment professionals that had not been considered fiduciaries under previous law . A fiduciary is subject to strict duties to act solely in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is personally liable to the ERISA plan for breaches in its discharge of its duties . The DOL Rule also contains exemptions , including the Best Interest Contract exemption ( the “ BIC Exemption ” ) and Principal Transactions in Certain Assets exemption ( the “ Principal Transactions Exemption ” ) , designed to enable investment professionals that become fiduciaries to continue to operate under existing business models that would otherwise be prohibited , subject to compliance with new conditions . In order to rely on these exemptions , we are required to : ( i ) act under defined impartial conduct standards that are in the best interest of our client ; ( ii ) adopt certain anti-conflict policies and procedures ; ( iii ) provide disclosure of certain information relating to fees , compensation and defined “ material conflicts of interest ; ” ( iv ) provide a written acknowledgment of fiduciary status ; 11RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESand ( v ) for IRAs and non-ERISA plans , enter into an enforceable contract with our client that contains extensive warranties and does not allow exculpatory provisions waiving the client ’ s rights and remedies , including the right to participate in a class action in court . The DOL Rule became effective as of June 2016 , subject to a phase-in of the fiduciary definition in June 2017 , and also subject to a further transition period until January 1 , 2018 applying to both the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption . In August 2017 , the DOL recommended that the transition period be extended until July 1 , 2019.We have undertaken a comprehensive plan to comply with the DOL Rule . As qualified accounts , particularly IRA accounts , comprise a significant portion of our business , we expect that compliance with the DOL Rule and reliance on the BIC Exemption and the Principal Transactions Exemption will require us to continue to incur increased levels of legal , compliance and information technology costs . As discussed above , we may also face enhanced legal risks . We anticipate that amendments to the scope of the DOL Rule or the adoption of any new rule by the SEC will require us to review and possibly modify our compliance plan and approach , which may also lead to additional costs . In addition , state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring , as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures.Incentive-Based Compensation ArrangementsPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions . The agencies have released a proposed rule that would prohibit certain forms of incentive-based compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than $ 1 billion in total assets ( the “ Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal ” ) . Much of the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal would apply to financial institutions categorized as either “ Level 1 ” institutions ( assets of $ 250 billion or more ) or “ Level 2 ” institutions ( assets of $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion ) , while “ Level 3 ” institutions ( assets of $ 1 billion to $ 50 billion ) would be subject to less extensive obligations . All covered financial institutions would be required to , among other requirements : ( i ) annually document the structure of their incentive-based compensation arrangements ; ( ii ) retain records of such annual documentation for at least seven years ; and ( iii ) comply with general prohibitions on incentive-based compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking . Should the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal be adopted , we would be subject to the rule ’ s requirements as a “ Level 3 ” financial institution , which would require us to incur additional legal and compliance costs , as well as subject us to increased legal risks.Other regulations applicable to our operationsThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the United States . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations , including sales and trading practices , public offerings , publication of research reports , use and safekeeping of client funds and securities , capital structure , record-keeping , privacy requirements , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . Broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others , and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form . These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates . The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules , many of which became effective as of October 2013 and are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries , including changes to the : ( i ) net capital rule ; ( ii ) customer protection rule ; ( iii ) record-keeping rules ; and ( iv ) notification rules . Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the United States , we have additional offices primarily in Canada and Europe and are subject to regulations in those areas . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the United States and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act ( “ SIPA ” ) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under SIPA , and oversees the 12RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESliquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the United States . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended ( the “ Investment Advisers Act ” ) , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ( the “ CRA ” ) . The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating . Members of the public may submit comments on a bank ’ s performance under the CRA ; such comments will form part of the bank ’ s performance evaluation . The results of the evaluation , together with the bank ’ s CRA rating , are also taken into consideration when evaluating mergers , acquisitions , and applications to open a branch or facility . RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA.RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration , as well as by the SROs and IIROC . IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( the “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian currency ( “ CDN ” ) per client , with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.In Europe , the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( together , “ MiFID II ” ) , will take effect on January 3 , 2018 , and will introduce comprehensive and new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the European Union , including new trading venues , enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency , and additional investor protection requirements , among others . Although the full impact of these changes remains unclear , we have made changes to our European operations , including systems and controls , in order to be in compliance with MiFID II.Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( “ Patriot Act ” ) and requirements administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( “ OFAC ” ) require financial institutions , among other things , to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism , including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting , compliance , record-keeping and due diligence on customers . The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government , including : due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts ; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions , regulators , and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism , money laundering and other crimes . Failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act , the Patriot Act , or OFAC can lead to supervisory actions including fines.13RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESOTHER INFORMATIONOur Internet address is www.raymondjames.com . We make available on our website , free of charge and in printer-friendly format including “ .pdf ” file extensions , our Annual Reports on Form 10-K , Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q , Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 ( a ) or 15 ( d ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with , or furnish it to , the SEC.Factors affecting “ forward-looking statements ” Certain statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute “ forward-looking statements ” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives , business prospects , anticipated savings , financial results ( including expenses , earnings , liquidity , cash flow and capital expenditures ) , industry or market conditions , demand for and pricing of our products , acquisitions and divestitures , anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments , effects of accounting pronouncements , or general economic conditions . In addition , words such as “ believes , ” “ expects , ” “ anticipates , ” “ intends , ” “ plans , ” “ estimates , ” “ projects , ” “ forecasts , ” and future or conditional verbs such as “ will , ” “ may , ” “ could , ” “ should , ” and “ would , ” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events , are intended to identify forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees , and they involve risks , uncertainties and assumptions . Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable , there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements . We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” in this report . We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise.Item 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . The list of risk factors provided below is not exhaustive ; there may be factors not discussed below or in this Form 10-K that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , investors and associates . If we fail to address , or appear to fail to address , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues may include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , record-keeping , and sales and trading practices , the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards , or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and reputational harm . Negative publicity about us , whether or not true , may also harm our future business prospects . We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including economic output levels , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , prices of commodities including oil and gas , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . For example , Fed policies determine , in large part , the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . Macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . 15RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESAt times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including low economic output levels , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , relatively high unemployment rates , and significant uncertainty with respect to domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions led to changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While global financial markets have improved , uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , a return to very low levels of short-term interest rates , credit market dislocations , reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability . Additionally , certain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading opportunities for our clients and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities or adversely affect the results of these activities . We could experience a decline in commission revenue from lower trading volumes , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from capital markets and advisory transactions due to reduced activity , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers ’ and market participants ’ failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses , including , but not limited to , our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited . U.S. markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in other parts of the world . Concerns about the European Union ( “ EU ” ) , including Britain ’ s June 2016 referendum to exit the EU ( “ Brexit ” ) , and the stability of the EU ’ s sovereign debt , has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the EU ’ s financial support programs . It is possible that other EU member states may experience financial troubles in the future , or may choose to follow Britain ’ s lead and leave the EU . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . U.S. state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue or worsen , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce investment banking revenues . In addition , such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is affected primarily by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the United States and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; unemployment and under-employment rates ; real estate prices ; consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . Deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.We must maintain appropriate liquidity levels . Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at unfavorable prices , and cutting or eliminating dividend payments . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , regulatory changes to the liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets for RJF , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority , and under certain circumstances , the duty , to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent.The availability of financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on various factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.16RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers ’ market making and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . Significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of loans , including C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and other loans collateralized by securities . We also incur credit risk through our investments . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , or geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our securities . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy.See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely , in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and private equity investments . Market 17RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESconditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , foreign exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing our capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts , and advisory fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts . In addition , the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products , which generate lower fees than actively managed products . A continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) . AUM balances are impacted by net inflows/outflows of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our values of AUM may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , despite risk mitigation policies , we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activities.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and , to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations , may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments ; however , our current focus is on the divestiture of our existing portfolio . We may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we can not sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.18RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESAny cyber-attack or other security breach of our technology systems , or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on , could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing , storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial , personal and other information in our computer systems and networks . There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber-attacks involving the theft , dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets , in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties . Like other financial services firms , we are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks , including unauthorized access , mishandling or misuse of information , computer viruses or malware , denial-of-service attacks , phishing or other forms of social engineering , and other events , and we seek to continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption . Cyber-attacks can originate from a variety of sources , including third parties affiliated with foreign governments , organized crime or terrorist organizations . Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . Although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches . However , the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls , including our cyber threat analytics , data encryption and tokenization technologies , anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management program , any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect , mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code , and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation , and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations . We also rely on numerous third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations , and we face similar risks relating to them . While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third party vendors , we can not be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach . In addition , in order to access our products and services , our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems . Notwithstanding the precautions we take , if a cyber-attack or other information security breach were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties , exposing us to liability . As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication , we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber-attacks to our customers . Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks , we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators . Further , successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants , whether or not we are affected , could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us , including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general , which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services.Further , in light of the high volume of transactions we process , the large number of our clients , partners and counterparties , and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors , a cyber-attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack would take substantial amounts of time , and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information . During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.We may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws . In providing services to clients , we manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal , state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.19RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSee Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our market , credit , operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective . Our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . While we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value . A failure to manage our growth adequately , including growth in the products or services we offer , or to manage our risk effectively , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest , which are under growing scrutiny by U.S. federal and state regulators and SROs such as FINRA . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities . A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report.We continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.We continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.20RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESWe face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , and location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry , which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , and the members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees , which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may work for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us . Recently , a large broker-dealer competitor announced its withdrawal from the Protocol for Broker Recruiting ( “ Protocol ” ) , a voluntary agreement among over 1,700 firms that governs , among other things , the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm . The ability to bring such customer data to a new broker-dealer generally means that the financial advisor is better able to move client account balances to his or her new firm . It is possible that other competitors will similarly withdraw from the Protocol . If the broker-dealers from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent , or significantly limit , the transfer of client data , our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected and we could experience a higher number of claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts . A downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations , earnings and financial condition.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our client relationships . Such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease 21RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESthe number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . We may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions . A credit rating downgrade would also result in RJF incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its $ 300 million revolving credit facility , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information on this revolving credit facility ) .Business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.We continue to grow through acquisitions . Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses , recruiting financial advisors , or making strategic acquisitions or investments . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . Moreover , to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms . We may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully . Difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise capital or borrow in order to finance an acquisition , which could result in dilution or increased leverage . We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all . A continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business.Our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : ( i ) successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ; ( ii ) address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and ( iii ) retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry . There is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . If our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business . In addition , our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely 22RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESaffect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected . We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses . In challenging market conditions , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related to the suitability of our investment recommendations ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and see Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available-for-sale securities including Auction Rate Securities ( “ ARS ” ) , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 in this report , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.The FASB has issued several new accounting standards , including on the topics of credit losses , revenue recognition and leases . 23RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESSpecifically , the new credit losses standard will replace multiple existing impairment models , including the replacement of the “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . We are evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of these standards will have on our financial position and results of operations . See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan & Company , Inc. , and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) , Regions has obligations to continue to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . Specifically , the terms of the agreement provide that Regions will indemnify RJF for losses incurred in connection with legal proceedings pending as of the closing date of that acquisition ( April 2 , 2012 ) , or commenced thereafter and related to pre-closing matters that were received prior to the closing date , as well as any cost of defense pertaining thereto . RJF is relying on Regions to continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations under the agreement with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions in the future , or our failure to recover future losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement , and any adverse judgments , and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the indemnification from Regions.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . As discussed above , weather events could also adversely impact certain loans within RJ Bank ’ s portfolio . Refer to Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management ” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our operational risk management.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world and as a result , are exposed to risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental or central bank policies , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from trading non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above mentioned factors . We are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks . We have elected to self-insure our workers compensation , errors and omissions liability and our employee-related health care benefit plans . We have self-insured retention risk related to our property and casualty , and general liability benefit plans . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , claims associated with risks we have retained either through our self-insurance retention or by self-insuring , may exceed our recorded reserves which could negatively impact future earnings . Insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.24RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms have been subject to regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years , increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Financial services firms over the last several years have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment , which could become more stringent in light of recent well-publicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud . The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from various regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . Penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws , rules and regulations.As a result of the demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated , including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry ( see Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for a discussion of such changes ) . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations will have on us , the financial industry and the economy at large can not be quantified until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented . Nevertheless , it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional compliance costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations , and interact with regulators , all of which could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have or may impact our businesses include : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers ; regulatory oversight of incentive compensation ; the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies ; prohibition of proprietary trading ; restrictions on investments in covered funds ; and , to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act , which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . The CFPB has had an active enforcement agenda and any action taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make such products and services less attractive , impose additional compliance measures , or result in fines , penalties or required remediation . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us . We are also required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading , due to our underwriting and market-making activities and our investments in covered funds , we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased operational and compliance costs and changes to our private equity investments . Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies , procedures and practices.Broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to : sales and trading methods ; trade practices among broker-dealers ; use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities ; capital structure of securities firms ; anti-money laundering efforts ; recordkeeping ; and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . There is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by RJF and its subsidiaries . In addition , from time to time , RJF and its affiliates may become subject to additional findings with respect to supervisory , compliance or other regulatory deficiencies , which could subject us to additional liability , including penalties , and restrictions on our business activities . Among other things , these restrictions could limit our ability to make investments , complete acquisitions , expand into new business lines , pay dividends and/or engage in share 25RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESrepurchases . See Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management , ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Changes in regulations resulting from the DOL Rule , including the DOL fiduciary standard , may adversely affect our businesses.The DOL Rule became effective earlier in the year , subject to a transition period until January 2018 applying to both the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption . Although we have undertaken a comprehensive plan to comply with the DOL Rule given that qualified accounts , particularly IRA accounts , comprise a significant portion of our business , we expect that compliance with the DOL Rule and reliance on the BIC Exemption and the Principal Transactions Exemption will require us to continue to incur increased legal , compliance and information technology costs . We anticipate that if the DOL Rule is amended , a rule imposing heightened standards on broker-dealers is adopted by the SEC , or fiduciary rules are adopted at the state level , we will be required to incur additional costs in order to review and possibly modify our compliance plan and approach . Implementation of the DOL Rule , any amendments to the rule , and any rules addressing similar matters will negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance , legal and information technology . In addition , we expect that our legal risks will increase , in part , as a result of the new contractual rights required to be given to IRA and non-ERISA plan clients under the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption.Numerous regulatory changes , and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity , relating to the asset management business may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The staff of the SEC ’ s Office of Compliance , Inspections and Examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to sub-transfer agents and sub-administrators for services that may be deemed to be distribution-related . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , their impact can not be fully ascertained at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . Asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries , which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors and broker-dealers . As some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations or initiatives that may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business . For example , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for broker-dealers ; however , any such standard , if mandated , would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes , as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliance.In addition , U.S. and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to take further actions , including expanding current ( or enacting new ) standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , several states and municipalities in the United States have adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees . Such “ pay-to-play ” rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business . Additionally , the use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future . A substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third-party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these additional costs . Furthermore , new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our asset management business and result in increased costs . For example , many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund business or other businesses , and changes to the laws , rules and regulations in the U.S. related to the over-the-counter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration , record keeping and reporting obligations.26RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the United States and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items , as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for both RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by U. S. federal regulators based on components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets , Tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory ( and potentially additional discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and financial condition . As more fully discussed in Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report , RJF and RJ Bank are required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the Fed . While we believe that both the quality and size of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile , the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capital.We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds . In addition , our Canada-based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by IIROC . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that RJF needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.The Basel III regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our profitability.In July 2013 , the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III Rules , which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The U.S. Basel III Rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . We became subject to the requirements under the final U.S. Basel III Rules as of January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The increased capital requirements stipulated under the U.S. Basel III Rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.As a financial holding company , RJF ’ s liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries , which may be subject to regulatory restrictions.RJF is a financial holding company and therefore depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations , including its debt service obligations . RJF ’ s subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to RJF . RJF ’ s broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in broker or bank accounts to fund their businesses . These requirements may hinder RJF ’ s ability to access funds from its subsidiaries . RJF may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock . The federal banking regulators , including the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC , as well as the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority and under certain circumstances , the obligation , to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise , including RJF and its bank subsidiaries . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.27RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL , INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . A successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , and the imposition of restrictions on mergers , acquisitions and expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.Item 1B .

( “ RJF ” or the “ Company ” ) is a financial holding company whose broker-dealer subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses , including the underwriting , distribution , trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products . In addition , other subsidiaries of RJF provide investment management services for retail and institutional clients , corporate and retail banking , and trust services . Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) since 1986 under the symbol “ RJF. ” As a financial holding company , RJF is subject to supervision , examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) . RJF ’ s principal subsidiaries are Raymond James & Associates , Inc. ( “ RJ & A ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services Advisors , Inc. ( “ RJFSA ” ) , Raymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) , Eagle Asset Management , Inc. ( “ Eagle ” ) , and Raymond James Bank , N.A . ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF . RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “ our , ” “ we , ” or “ us. ” Our operations are predominately conducted in the United States of America ( “ U.S. ” ) and Canada . Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , advisors , associates and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through four operating segments and our “ Other ” segment . The four operating segments are “ Private Client Group ” ( “ PCG ” ) , “ Capital Markets , ” “ Asset Management , ” and RJ Bank . The Other segment captures principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF . The graph below depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our operating segments for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2016 : *Chart above does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.3IndexPRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide financial planning and securities transaction services to more than 2.9 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom through Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS ” ) . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice . Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option.We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain key revenue producers , primarily for transitional cost assistance and retention purposes.Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as of September 30 , 2016 amount to $ 574.1 billion . We have 7,146 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2016 . Employee Financial AdvisorsEmployee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to individual clients . These financial advisors are our employees , and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans . Independent Contractor Financial AdvisorsOur financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , they are permitted to conduct , on a limited basis , certain other approved business activities , such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services . Irrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues from this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration , and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature . The proportion of our securities commissions and fee revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced . Securities commissions and fee revenues by affiliation , as well as the portion of total segment revenues that is recurring versus transactional in nature , for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2016 , are presented below : 4IndexWe provide the following types of services through this segment : •We provide investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules . •We offer investment advisory services .

However , RJ & A will also loan client marginable securities in a margin account containing a debit ( referred to as lending from the “ box ” ) to counterparties . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest . The net revenues of this business consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities.•Through our Alternative Investments Group , we provide diversification strategies and products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors . The Alternative Investments Group provides strategies and products for portfolio investment allocation opportunities where a selective addition of alternative investments that have historically demonstrated lower correlation to traditional market indices may reduce overall portfolio volatility and increase long-term performance . •Through the formation of the Alex . Brown division of RJ & A , we enhanced our capabilities to service the needs of ultra-high-net-worth clients and select institutions.. 5IndexCAPITAL MARKETSOur capital markets segment conducts institutional sales , securities trading , equity research , investment banking , syndicate , and the syndication of investments that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code ( referred to as our “ tax credit funds ” ) . Within our management structure , we distinguish between activities that support equity and fixed income products and services . We primarily conduct these activities in the U.S. , Canada , and Europe . The graph below depicts the portions of this segment ’ s revenues that are derived from equity securities and products , fixed income securities and products , and our tax credit funds activities for the fiscal year ended September 30 , 2016 : We provide the following services through this segment : Equity Capital Markets Activities•We earn institutional sales commissions on the sale of equity products . Sales volume is influenced by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients . Commission amounts on equity transactions are based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . •We provide various investment banking services including public and private equity financing for corporate clients and merger and acquisition advisory services . Our investment banking activities include a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients ’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus . •In our syndicate operations , we coordinate the marketing , distribution , pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings . In addition to lead and co-managed offerings , this department coordinates our participation in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.•Our domestic research department supports our institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on a wide variety of companies . This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries , including agricultural , consumer , energy , clean energy , energy services , financial services , healthcare , industrial , mining and natural resources , forest products , real estate , technology , and communication and transportation . Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients . 6IndexFixed Income Activities•We earn institutional sales commissions from institutional clients who purchase both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products , primarily municipal , corporate , government agency and mortgage-backed bonds . The commissions that we charge on fixed income products are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.•We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities . Our taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate , municipal , government , government agency , and mortgage-backed bonds , asset-backed securities , preferred stock , and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers . •Our fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor , placement agent or underwriter to various issuers , including state and local government agencies ( and their political subdivisions ) , housing agencies , and non-profit entities including health care and higher education institutions .

When underwriting new issue securities , we may agree to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submission of a competitive bid.•In order to facilitate client transactions , hedge a portion of our fixed income securities inventories , or to a limited extent for our own account , we enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts . In addition , we conduct a “ matched book ” derivatives business where we may enter into derivative transactions , including interest rate swaps , options , and combinations of those instruments , primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties . In this matched book business , for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client , we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third party financial institution . •Through our fixed income public finance operations , we enter into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association ( “ GNMA ” ) or Federal National Mortgage Association ( “ FNMA ” ) MBS . Such MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies ( “ HFA ” ) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs.Tax Credit Fund Activities•In our syndication of tax credit investments , one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code . We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.7IndexASSET MANAGEMENTOur Asset Management segment provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investment portfolios , and sponsors mutual funds under the name “ Eagle ” ( “ Eagle Funds ” ) .

In managed programs , we make decisions about how to invest the assets in accordance with such programs objectives . In non-discretionary asset-based programs , we provide administrative support to each plan , which may include trade execution , record-keeping and periodic investor reporting . We generally earn higher fees for managed programs than for non-discretionary asset-based programs , since we provide additional services to managed programs . As of September 30 , 2016 , there were $ 77.0 billion in financial assets held in managed programs and $ 119.3 billion in financial assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs . The graph below depicts financial assets under management in our managed programs by objective as of September 30 , 2016:8IndexRJ BANKRJ Bank provides corporate loans , securities based loans ( “ SBL ” ) and residential loans . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . RJ Bank operates primarily from a branch location adjacent to RJF ’ s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank ’ s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , tax-exempt loans , as well as loans fully collateralized by marketable securities . Corporate loans represent approximately 70 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , of which 95 % are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients . RJ Bank has total assets of $ 16.6 billion at September 30 , 2016 , which are comprised of the following : OTHEROur “ Other ” segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF , such as the interest cost on our senior notes payable , and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions ( See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on our acquisitions ) .

EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORSOur employees and independent contractors ( collectively “ associates ” ) are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As of September 30 , 2016 , we had over 11,900 employees , and over 4,000 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors.9IndexOPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel at various locations throughout the U.S. who are responsible for processing securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , the receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations . RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver , British Columbia.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business . This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients . We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and Company information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . Our business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a staff which devotes its full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida or one of our operations processing or data center sites in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee or Michigan.We have also developed a business continuity plan for each of our PCG retail branches in the event any of these branches is impacted by severe weather . COMPETITIONThe financial services industry is an intensely competitive business . We compete with many other financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , services , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONRJF is a bank holding company subject to the Bank Holding Company Act that has made an election to be a financial holding company . As a financial holding company , RJF is subject to regulation , oversight , and supervision , including periodic examination , by the Fed . RJ Bank is a national bank regulated , supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) , and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our trust company subsidiary also is regulated , supervised and examined by the OCC . The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and the trust company . Collectively , the rules and regulations of the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business , including , for example , lending practices , the receipt of deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , conduct and qualifications of personnel , and as discussed further below , capital requirements . This regulatory and supervisory framework is currently subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF , RJ Bank and the trust company . As a part of their supervisory function , the Fed , the OCC , the FDIC , and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and , in the case of the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC , unsafe or unsound practices . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries , which also are registered investment advisors , are subject to regulation and oversight by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities discussed under “ Other regulations applicable to our operations ” below.The following discussion summarizes briefly the principal elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to RJF . The framework is intended to protect our clients and customers , the integrity of the financial markets , and our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders . These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities , as well as our ability to upstream to RJF funds from our regulated subsidiaries , which include RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and 10Indexregulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business.Rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank ActIn July 2010 , the U.S. government enacted sweeping changes to the supervision and regulation of the financial industry through the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( the “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . The Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings , studies and reports . These regulatory agencies include : the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ; the Securities and Exchange Commission ( the “ SEC ” ) ; the Fed ; the OCC ; the FDIC ; the CFPB ; and the Financial Stability Oversight Council . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately ; however , the details of some provisions are subject to implementing regulations . Furthermore , some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years . As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms , we are experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and supervision . These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business . Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux . As a result , we can not specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations ( see Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . Below , we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.FDIC Assessment RatesSince RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . In February 2011 , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base . For banks with greater than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation , which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail . This new rule became effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period . CFPB OversightIn July 2011 , the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and was provided broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under several consumer protection laws , including the : ( i ) Equal Credit Opportunity Act ; ( ii ) Truth in Lending Act ; ( iii ) Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ; ( iv ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ; ( v ) Fair Debt Collection Act ; ( vi ) Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and unfair , deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act . Beginning with fiscal year 2014 , the CFPB assumed supervisory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations , issue orders , draft policy statements , conduct examinations , and bring enforcement actions . The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws . To the extent that , as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight , we become the subject of any enforcement activity , we may be required to pay fines , incur penalties , or engage in certain remediation efforts.Stress TestsIn October 2012 , the Fed , FDIC and OCC jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies , state member banks , and savings and loan companies with total assets between $ 10 billion and $ 50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests , report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed ( who is RJF ’ s primary regulator ) , and publish a summary of the results . Stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios ( baseline , adverse , and severely adverse ) prescribed by the Fed . RJF was required to conduct its first stress test by March 2014 . The Dodd-Frank Act also required that RJF begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results no later than June 30 , 2015 for the stress test cycle beginning on October 1 , 2014 . The summary of certain stress test results is available on our website under “ More ... - Investors - Financial Reports - Other Reports and Information - 2016 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Disclosure ” ( the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report ) .11IndexThe Volcker RuleRJF is subject to the Volcker Rule , which generally prohibits , subject to exceptions , insured depository institutions , bank holding companies and their affiliates ( together , “ Banking Entities ” ) from engaging in “ proprietary trading ” or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund ( “ covered funds ” ) . Banking Entities engaged in proprietary trading and/or investments in covered funds must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program . We have adopted a program , which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule , however , in connection with their examinations , regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program . The Volcker Rule also limits investments in , and relationships with , covered funds . The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds has been extended and Banking Entities may still apply for an additional five-year extension with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds . We maintain a number of private equity investments , some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule . The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and implement any additional actions necessary for conformance with the rule . To the extent that any of our covered funds satisfy the Fed ’ s criteria for further extension for certain illiquid funds , we may apply for such extensions , although there is no assurance that any such extension would be granted.Basel III and U.S. Capital RulesBoth RJF , as a bank holding company , and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to recent regulatory actions . In July 2013 , the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC released final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums ( the “ U.S . Basel III Rules ” ) . The U.S. Basel III Rules : ( i ) increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital ; ( ii ) establish a capital conservation buffer ; and ( iii ) make changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1 , 2015 , subject to applicable phase-in periods . The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank as of January 1 , 2016 . See Note 25 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding RJF and RJ Bank regulatory capital levels and ratios , including information regarding the capital conservation buffer . The increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for more information.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary , and in certain cases , mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of : ( i ) Common Equity Tier 1 ( or “ CET1 ” ) , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ; ( ii ) Tier 1 capital to average assets ; and ( iii ) capital conservation buffers . See Item 7 , “ Regulatory ” in this report and Note 25 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K , for further information.Money Market FundsIn July 2014 , the SEC adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds . The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds , while preserving the benefits of the funds . We do not sponsor any money market funds . We utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes as well as to offer our clients with money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternatives.Municipal Advisor RegulationIn September 2013 , the SEC issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of “ municipal advisors ” as required under the Dodd-Frank Act . These final rules for municipal advisors , which became effective in July 2014 : ( i ) impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities ; ( ii ) may result in the need for new written representations by issuers ; and ( iii ) may limit the manner in which we , in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles , interact with municipal issuers . Our municipal finance business became subject to additional regulation and oversight by the SEC by virtue of our registration with the SEC as a municipal advisor in 2014 . In August 2014 , the SEC also announced that it will undertake a two-year review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative . 12IndexMoreover , in December 2015 , the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ( the “ MSRB ” ) received approval from the SEC on new MSRB Rule G-42 ( regarding duties of non-solicitor municipal advisors ) and related amendments to MSRB Rule G-8 ( regarding books and records to be made by municipal advisors , among others ) , all of which became effective in June 2016 . Additional rulemaking by the MSRB may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local governments are able to interact with outside finance professionals . These new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients , as well as potentially have a negative short-term impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape . However , we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations , which are included in our Capital Markets segment . Fiduciary Duty StandardPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . The SEC has not yet proposed rules relating to a new standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers . However in April 2016 , the U.S. Department of Labor ( the “ DOL ” ) issued its final regulation ( the “ DOL Rule ” ) expanding the definition of who is deemed an “ investment advice fiduciary ” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , as amended ( “ ERISA ” ) , as a result of giving investment advice to a “ plan , ” “ plan participant ” or “ beneficiary , ” as well as under the Internal Revenue Code for individual retirement arrangements ( “ IRAs ” ) and non-ERISA plans ( collectively , “ qualified plans ” ) . As a result of adopting a new definition of “ fiduciary ” under ERISA , the final rule extends fiduciary status to many investment professionals that have not been considered fiduciaries under current law . A fiduciary is subject to strict duties to act solely in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is personally liable to the ERISA plan for breaches in its discharge of its duties . The DOL Rule also contains exemptions , including the Best Interest Contract exemption ( the “ BIC Exemption ” ) and Principal Transactions in Certain Assets exemption ( the “ Principal Transactions Exemption ” ) , designed to enable investment professionals that will become fiduciaries to continue to operate under existing business models that would otherwise be prohibited , subject to compliance with new conditions . In order to rely on these exemptions , we will be required to : ( i ) act under defined impartial conduct standards that are in the best interest of our client ; ( ii ) adopt certain anti-conflict policies and procedures ; ( iii ) provide disclosure of certain information relating to fees , compensation and defined “ material conflicts of interest ; ” ( iv ) provide a written acknowledgment of fiduciary status ; and ( v ) for IRAs and non-ERISA plans , enter into an enforceable contract with our client that contains extensive warranties and does not allow exculpatory provisions waiving the client ’ s rights and remedies , including the right to participate in a class action in court . The DOL Rule became effective as of June 7 , 2016 , with phase-in of the fiduciary definition not applicable until April 10 , 2017 , and further transition periods until January 1 , 2018 applying to both the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption.We are evaluating the impact of the DOL Rule on our business . However , because qualified accounts , particularly IRA accounts , comprise a significant portion of our business , we expect that compliance with the DOL Rule and reliance on the BIC Exemption and the Principal Transactions Exemption will require us to incur increased legal , compliance and information technology costs . In addition , as discussed above , we may face enhanced legal risks.Incentive-Based Compensation ArrangementsPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions . The agencies have released a proposed rule that would prohibit certain forms of incentive-based compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than $ 1 billion in total assets ( the “ Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal ” ) . Much of the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal would apply to financial institutions categorized as either “ Level 1 ” institutions ( assets of $ 250 billion or more ) or “ Level 2 ” institutions ( assets of $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion ) , while “ Level 3 ” institutions ( assets of $ 1 billion to $ 50 billion ) would be subject to less extensive obligations . All covered financial institutions would be required to , among other requirements : ( i ) annually document the structure of their incentive-based compensation arrangements ; ( ii ) retain records of such annual documentation for at least seven years ; and ( iii ) comply with general prohibitions on incentive-based compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking . Should the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal be adopted , we would be subject to the rule ’ s requirements as a “ Level 3 ” financial institution , which would require us to incur additional legal and compliance costs , as well as subject us to increased legal risks.13IndexOther regulations applicable to our operationsThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the United States . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations , including sales and trading practices , public offerings , publication of research reports , use and safekeeping of client funds and securities , capital structure , record-keeping , privacy requirements , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . Broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others , and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form . These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates . The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules , many of which became effective as of October 2013 and are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries , including changes to the ; ( i ) net capital rule ; ( ii ) customer protection rule ; ( iii ) record-keeping rules ; and ( iv ) notification rules . We continue to evaluate the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries ; however , based on our current analysis , we do not believe these amendments will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the United States , we have additional offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America that are subject to local regulatory bodies in these territories.Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the United States and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act ( “ SIPA ” ) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under SIPA , and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration , as well as by the SROs and IIROC . IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( the “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian currency ( “ CDN ” ) per client , with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the United States . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended ( the “ Investment Advisers Act ” ) , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ( the “ CRA ” ) . The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank one of the following public CRA ratings : “ outstanding ; ” “ satisfactory ; ” “ needs to improve ; ” or “ substantial noncompliance. ” Members of the public may submit comments on a bank ’ s performance under the CRA ; such comments will form part of the bank ’ s performance evaluation . The results of the evaluation , together with the bank ’ s CRA rating , are also taken into consideration 14Indexwhen evaluating mergers , acquisitions , and applications to open a branch or facility . RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA.Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ( “ Patriot Act ” ) and requirements administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( “ OFAC ” ) require financial institutions , among other things , to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism , including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting , compliance , record-keeping and due diligence on customers . The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government , including : due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts ; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening ; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions , regulators , and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism , money laundering and other crimes . Failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act , the Patriot Act , or OFAC can lead to supervisory actions including fines.EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTExecutive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) are as follows : Jennifer C.

We make available on our website , free of charge and in printer-friendly format including “ .pdf ” file extensions , our Annual Reports on Form 10-K , Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q , Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 ( a ) or 15 ( d ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with , or furnish it to , the SEC.Factors affecting “ forward-looking statements ” Certain statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute “ forward-looking statements ” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . Forward-looking statements include information concerning future strategic objectives , business prospects , anticipated savings , financial results ( including expenses , earnings , liquidity , cash flow and capital expenditures ) , industry or market conditions , demand for and pricing of our products , acquisitions and divestitures , anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or general economic conditions . In addition , words such as “ believes , ” “ expects , ” “ anticipates , ” “ intends , ” “ plans , ” “ estimates , ” “ projects , ” “ forecasts , ” and future or conditional verbs such as “ will , ” “ may , ” “ could , ” “ should , ” and “ would , ” as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events , are intended to identify forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees , and they involve risks , uncertainties and assumptions . Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable , there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements . We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” in this report . We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise.Item 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . The list of risk factors provided below is not exhaustive ; there may be factors not discussed below or in this Form 10-K that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , customers , investors and associates . If we fail to address , or appear to fail to address , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues may include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , record-keeping , and sales and trading practices , the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards , or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly , can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and reputational harm . Further , negative publicity about us , whether or not true , may also harm our future business prospects . We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including economic output levels , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , prices of commodities including oil and gas , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . For example , Fed policies determine , in large part , the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . Macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . 16IndexAt times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including low economic output levels , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , relatively high unemployment rates , and significant uncertainty with respect to domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions led to changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While global financial markets have shown signs of improvement , uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short-term interest rates , a return to increased credit market dislocations , reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability . We could experience a decline in commission revenue from lower trading volumes , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from capital markets and advisory transactions due to reduced activity , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers ’ and market participants ’ failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses , including , but not limited to , our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and , our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited . U.S. markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe and Russia . Concerns about the European Union ( “ EU ” ) , including Britain ’ s June 23 , 2016 referendum to exit the EU ( “ Brexit ” ) , and the stability of the EU ’ s sovereign debt , has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the EU ’ s financial support programs . It is possible that other EU member states may experience financial troubles in the future , or may choose to follow Britain ’ s lead and leave the EU . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . U.S. state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue or worsen , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce investment banking revenues . In addition , such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the United States and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; the unemployment and under-employment rates ; real estate prices ; consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . Deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.We must maintain appropriate liquidity levels . Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , sell assets at unfavorable prices , and cut or eliminate dividend payments . Our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , regulatory changes to the liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets for RJF , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority , and under certain circumstances , the duty , to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent.The availability of financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on various factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.17IndexA downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations , earnings and financial condition.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our client relationships . Such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . We may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions ( see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for such information ) . A credit rating downgrade would also result in RJF incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its $ 300 million revolving credit facility executed on August 6 , 2015 , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information on this revolving credit facility ) .We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely , in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives , and venture capital and private equity investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing our capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our venture capital and private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers ’ market making and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold 18Indexcertain securities , loans and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . Significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of : C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and other loans collateralized by securities . We incur credit risk through our investments . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , or geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us 19Indexcannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries , and advisory fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) . AUM balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , despite risk mitigation policies , we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activities.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and , to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations , may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments . We may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we can not sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.We continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.We continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , and location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the 20Indexfinancial services industry , which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology , including improvements made to internet connectivity , networking and telecommunications systems.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , particularly our managing directors , and the members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees , which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may work for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.Business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.Integrating acquired businesses , including for example , the September 6 , 2016 acquisition of the U.S . Private Client Services unit of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management ( “ Alex . Brown ” ) and the August 31 , 2016 acquisition of MacDougall , MacDougall & MacTier , Inc. ( “ 3Macs ” ) , as well as providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses , recruiting financial advisors , or making strategic acquisitions or investments . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . 21IndexMoreover , to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms . We may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully . Difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise capital or borrow in order to finance an acquisition , which could result in dilution or increased leverage . We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all . A continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business.Our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : ( i ) successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ; ( ii ) address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and ( iii ) retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.Security breaches of our technology systems , or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on , could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.The expectations of sound operational and informational security practices have risen among our clients and vendors , the public at large and regulators . Our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures , disruptions , cyber-attacks and breakdowns . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches . However , there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations . Notwithstanding the precautions we take , if one or more of these events were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , including that of our clients and counterparties , which is processed , stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients and counterparties . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications . We may also be subject to litigation and financial losses that are neither insured nor covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.In providing services to clients , we may manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.22IndexSee Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry . There is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . If our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business . In addition , our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected . Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . Refer to the “ we are exposed to credit risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events , including weather events , could adversely impact RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . Refer to the “ a continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems , or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize , could be materially adverse to our business ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events beyond our control , including weather-related events , could impact our ability to conduct business.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan & Company , Inc. , and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) , Regions has obligations to continue to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . Specifically , the terms of the agreement provide that Regions will indemnify RJF for losses incurred in connection with legal proceedings pending as of the closing date of that acquisition ( April 2 , 2012 ) , or commenced thereafter and related to pre-closing matters that were received prior to the closing date , as well as any cost of defense pertaining thereto . RJF is relying on Regions to continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions in the future , or our failure to recover future losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement , and any adverse judgments , and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the indemnification from Regions.We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses . In highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related 23Indexto the suitability of our investment recommendations ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in the real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available for sale securities including Auction Rate Securities ( “ ARS ” ) , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 in this report , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.In June 2016 , the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for credit losses . The new standard will replace multiple existing impairment models , including the replacement of the “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . We are evaluating the potential impact its adoption , which will occur no later than the quarter ended December 31 , 2020 , will have on our financial position and results of operations . Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective . Our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . While we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and 24Indexthe judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to manage our growth adequately , or to manage our risk effectively , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest , which are under growing scrutiny by U.S. federal and state regulators . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities . A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions commonly known as emerging markets , and as a result , are exposed to risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental or central bank policies , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from trading non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the abovementioned factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets , particularly those in emerging markets , are generally smaller and less developed , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.We have risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years , increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Financial services firms have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment , which will become even more stringent in light of recent well-publicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud . The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from various regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . Penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws , rules and regulations . Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services , including , but not limited to , the authority to fine us and to grant , cancel , restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses or engage in certain activities . Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could harm our business prospects through adverse financial effects and reputational harm.25IndexChanges in regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act , the DOL Rules , including the new fiduciary standard , or any new regulations or laws may adversely affect our businesses.Market and economic conditions over the past several years have directly led to a demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated , including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry ( see Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for a discussion of such changes ) . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations will have on us , the financial industry and the economy at large can not be quantified until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented . Nevertheless , it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional compliance costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations , and interact with regulators , all of which could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have ( or may ) impact our businesses include : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers ; regulatory oversight of incentive compensation ; the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies ; restrictions on proprietary trading ; and , to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act , which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . The CFPB has had an active enforcement agenda and any action taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make such products and services less attractive , impose additional compliance measures , or result in fines , penalties or required remediation . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us . We were required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions beginning on July 21 , 2015 . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading , due to our underwriting and market making activities , the Volcker Rule will likely adversely affect our results of operations through increased operational and compliance costs , possible reductions in our trading revenues , and changes to our private equity investments.We are evaluating the impact of the DOL Rule on our business . However , because qualified accounts , particularly IRA accounts , comprise a significant portion of our business , we expect that implementation of the DOL Rule will negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance , legal and information technology . In addition , we expect that our legal risks will increase , in part , as a result of the new contractual rights required to be given to IRA and non-ERISA plan clients under the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption.The Basel III regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitability.In July 2013 , the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III Rules , which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The U.S. Basel III Rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . We became subject to the requirements under the final U.S. Basel III Rules as of January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The increased capital requirements stipulated under the U.S. Basel III Rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . We continue to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Basel III Rules on both RJ Bank and RJF.Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the United States , and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items , as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for both RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by U. S. federal regulators based on components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by 26Indexregulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets , Tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory ( and potentially additional discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and financial condition . As more fully discussed in Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report , RJF is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the Fed . While we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile , the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capital.We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds . In addition , our Canada-based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by IIROC . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that RJF needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.As a financial holding company , RJF ’ s liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries , which may be subject to regulatory restrictions.RJF is a financial holding company and therefore depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations , including debt service . RJF ’ s subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to RJF . RJF ’ s broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in broker or bank accounts to fund their businesses . These requirements may hinder RJF ’ s ability to access funds from its subsidiaries . RJF may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock . The federal banking regulators , including the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC , as well as the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority and under certain circumstances , the obligation , to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise , including RJF and its bank subsidiaries . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The securities industry is subject to extensive and constantly changing regulation . Broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to : sales and trading methods ; trade practices among broker-dealers ; use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities ; capital structure of securities firms ; anti-money laundering efforts ; recordkeeping ; and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . Any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.As a financial holding company , we are regulated by the Fed . RJ Bank is regulated by the OCC , the Fed , the CFPB , and the FDIC . This oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations . The economic and political environment over the past several years has resulted in increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry , including many proposals for new rules . Any new rules issued by U.S. regulators that oversee the financial services industry could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . We also may be adversely affected as a result of changes to federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . 27IndexRegulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . There is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by RJF and its subsidiaries . In addition , from time to time , RJF and its affiliates may become subject to additional findings with respect to compliance or other regulatory deficiencies , which could subject us to additional liability , including penalties . See Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Numerous regulatory changes , and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity , relating to the asset management business may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The staff of the SEC ’ s Office of Compliance , Inspections and Examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to sub-transfer agents and sub-administrators for services that may be deemed to be distribution-related . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , their impact can not be fully ascertained at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . Asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries , which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors and broker-dealers . As some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations or initiatives that may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business . For example , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for broker-dealers ; however , any such standard , if mandated , would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes , as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliance.In addition , U.S. and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to take further actions , including expanding current ( or enacting new ) standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , several states and municipalities in the United States have adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees . Such “ pay-to-play ” rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business . Additionally , the use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future . A substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third-party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these additional costs . Furthermore , new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs . For example , many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund business or other businesses , and changes to the laws , rules and regulations in the United States related to the over-the-counter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration , recordkeeping and reporting obligations.RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . A successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , and the imposition of restrictions on mergers , acquisitions and expansion 28Indexactivity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.Item 1B .

( “ RJF ” or the “ Company ” ) is a financial holding company whose broker-dealer subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses , including the underwriting , distribution , trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products . In addition , other subsidiaries of RJF provide investment management services for retail and institutional clients , corporate and retail banking , and trust services . Established in 1962 and public since 1983 , RJF has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( the “ NYSE ” ) since 1986 under the symbol “ RJF ” . As a financial holding company , RJF is subject to the oversight and periodic examination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) . Through its operations which are predominately conducted in the United States of America ( the “ U.S. ” ) and Canada , RJF ’ s principal subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates , Inc. ( “ RJ & A ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services Advisors , Inc. ( “ RJFSA ” ) , Raymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) , Eagle Asset Management , Inc. ( “ Eagle ” ) , and Raymond James Bank , N.A . ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF . RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “ our , ” “ we ” or “ us. ” Among the keys to our historical and continued success , our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values . We also believe in maintaining a conservative , long-term focus in our decision making . We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong , stable financial services firm for clients , advisors , associates and shareholders.REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through four operating segments and our “ Other ” segment . The four operating segments include “ Private Client Group ” ( or “ PCG ” ) , “ Capital Markets , ” “ Asset Management , ” and RJ Bank . The Other segment captures principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF . The graphic below provides an indication of the relative net revenue contribution associated with each of our operating segments in the most recent fiscal year . *Chart above does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment.3IndexPRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide financial planning and securities transaction services to more than 2.7 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom ( “ UK ” ) through Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS ” ) . Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options , which we refer to as AdvisorChoice.Experienced financial advisors are recruited from a wide variety of competitors . As a part of their agreement to join us , we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain key revenue producers , primarily for recruiting , transitional cost assistance , and retention purposes.Our two primary affiliation options are either the employee or an independent contractor financial advisor option.Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as of September 30 , 2015 amount to $ 453.3 billion . We have 6,596 financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30 , 2015 . Employee Financial AdvisorsTraditional employee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . They provide services predominately to individual clients . These financial advisors are employees and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans . Independent ContractorsIndependent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees than employee financial advisors . Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need . With specific approval , they are permitted to conduct , on a limited basis , certain other approved business activities such as offering insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services . Over the past several fiscal years , the mix of securities commissions and fees revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation option has become more balanced , partially due to our fiscal year 2012 acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( as hereinafter defined ) which operated an employee financial advisor business model . Irrespective of the affiliation choice , our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . Revenues of this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration , and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature . Securities commissions and fees revenues by affiliation , as well as the portion of total segment revenues that are recurring versus transactional in nature , for the twelve months ended September 30 , 2015 , respectively , are presented below : 4IndexA summary of the services we provide that are captured in this segment include the following : •We provide investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules . •We offer investment advisory services under various financial advisor affiliation options . Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account , or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice.•The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Raymond James Insurance Group , Inc. ( “ RJIG ” ) .•Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load mutual funds.•Clients ’ transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . These margin loans to clients are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loan.•We provide certain custodial , trading , research and other back office support and services ( including access to clients ’ account information and the services of the Asset Management segment ) to the independent contractor registered investment advisors with whom we are affiliated.•We conduct securities lending activities through our RJ & A subsidiary , where we borrow and lend securities from and to other broker-dealers , financial institutions , and other counterparties . Generally , we conduct these activities as an intermediary ( referred to as “ Matched Book ” ) . However , RJ & A will also loan client marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit ( referred to as lending from the “ Box ” ) to counterparties . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest . The net revenues of the securities lending business are the interest spreads generated on these activities.•Through our Alternative Investments Group , we provide diversification strategies and products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors . The Alternative Investments Group provides strategies and products for portfolio investment allocation opportunities where a selective addition of alternative investments that have historically demonstrated lower correlation to traditional market indices may reduce overall portfolio volatility through diversification and increase long-term portfolio performance through a variety of market conditions . . 5IndexCAPITAL MARKETSActivities conducted in our capital markets segment include : institutional sales , securities trading , equity research , investment banking , syndicate , and the syndication of investments that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code . Within our management structure , we distinguish between activities that support equity and fixed income products and services . We primarily conduct these activities in the U.S. , Canada , and Europe . The graphic below provides an indication of the relative portion of this segment ’ s revenues that are associated with equity securities and products , fixed income securities and products , and our tax credit fund syndication activities.A summary of the services we provide that are captured in this segment include the following : Equity Capital Markets activities•Institutional sales commissions are earned on equity products fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients . Commission amounts on equity transactions are based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . •We provide various investment banking services through activities including public and private equity financing for corporate clients , and merger and acquisition advisory services . Our investment banking activities provide a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients ’ business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus . •In our syndicate operations , professionals coordinate the marketing , distribution , pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings . In addition to lead and co-managed offerings , this department coordinates the firm ’ s syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.•Analysts in our domestic research department support our institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on certain companies . This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries including agricultural , consumer , energy , clean energy , energy services , financial services , healthcare , industrial , mining and natural resources , forest products , real estate , technology , and communication and transportation . Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients . 6IndexFixed Income activities•Institutional sales commissions are earned on fixed income products from institutional clients who purchase both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products , primarily municipal , corporate , government agency and mortgage-backed bonds . Commission amounts on fixed income products are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.•We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities . We trade both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income securities primarily for the purpose of facilitating such sales . The taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate , municipal , government , government agency , and mortgage-backed bonds , asset-backed securities , preferred stock , and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers . •Our fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor , placement agent or underwriter to various issuers who include municipal agencies ( including political subdivisions ) , housing developers , and non-profit health care institutions . We may also act as a consultant , underwriter , or selling group member for corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities ( “ MBS ” ) , whole loans , agency bonds , preferred stock and unit investment trusts . When underwriting new issue securities , we may agree to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submit a competitive bid.•To facilitate client transactions , hedge a portion of our fixed income securities inventories , or to a limited extent for our own account , we enter into interest rate swaps , futures contracts , and forward foreign exchange contracts as part of our fixed income business activities . In addition , we conduct a “ matched book ” derivatives business where we may enter into derivative transactions , including interest rate swaps , options , and combinations of those instruments , primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties . In this matched book business , for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client , we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution . •Through our fixed income public finance operations , we enter into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association ( “ GNMA ” ) , or Federal National Mortgage Association ( “ FNMA ” ) , MBS . The MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies ( “ HFA ” ) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs.Tax Credit Fund investment syndication activities•In our syndication of tax credit investments , one of our subsidiaries is the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code . We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products to investors as well as for oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.7IndexASSET MANAGEMENTOur Asset Management segment operations include Eagle , the Eagle Family of Funds ( “ Eagle Funds ” ) , asset management operations conducted within our asset management services division for the benefit of our PCG clients ( referred to as “ AMS ” ) , Raymond James Trust , National Association ( “ RJ Trust ” ) a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF , and other fee-based programs . We generate revenues in this segment by providing investment advisory and asset management services to either individual or institutional investment portfolios , along with mutual funds . Investment advisory fee revenues are earned on the assets held in either managed or non-discretionary asset-based programs . As of September 30 , 2015 , there were $ 65.2 billion in financial assets held in managed programs and $ 91.0 billion in financial assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs . In managed programs , we are making decisions , in accordance with such programs objectives , about how to invest the assets held in such programs . In non-discretionary asset-based programs , we are providing administrative support to each plan , providing as an example , trade execution , record-keeping , and periodic investor reporting , for assets held in such programs . We generally earn higher fees for managed programs than we do for non-discretionary asset-based programs , which is to be expected given that additional services are provided to managed programs , most notably investment advice . The graphic below provides the financial assets under management in managed programs by objective.8IndexRJ BANKRJ Bank provides corporate , securities based loans ( “ SBL ” ) and residential loans , as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts , to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . RJ Bank operates primarily from a branch location adjacent to RJF ’ s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank ’ s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , tax-exempt loans , as well as loans fully collateralized by marketable securities . Corporate loans represent approximately 75 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio of which 90 % are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients . RJ Bank has total assets of $ 14.2 billion at September 30 , 2015 , which are comprised of the following : OTHEROur other segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF including the interest cost on our public debt , and the acquisition and integration costs associated with our material acquisitions including , most significantly in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , Morgan Keegan ( as hereinafter defined ) . Our principal capital and private equity activities include various direct and third party private equity investments ; employee investment funds ( the “ Employee Funds ” ) ; and various private equity funds which we sponsor . On April 2 , 2012 ( the “ Closing Date ” ) , RJF completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan & Company , Inc. ( “ MK & Co. ” ) , and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to hereinafter as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) . In mid-February 2013 , we completed the transfer of all of the active businesses of MK & Co. to RJ & A . EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORSOur employees and independent contractors ( collectively referred to hereinafter as “ associates ” ) , are vital to our success in the financial services industry . As of September 30 , 2015 , we had approximately 11,000 employees , and more than 3,850 independent contractor financial advisors with whom we are affiliated.9IndexOPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSINGWe have operations personnel who are responsible for the processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations through locations throughout the United States . RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver , British Columbia.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business . This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information assets as well as those we have pertaining to our clients . Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of both client and Company information.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . Business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a staff which devotes their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at our corporate headquarters in Florida , or one of our operations processing or data center sites in Florida , Colorado , Tennessee and Michigan.We have also developed a business continuity plan for each of our PCG retail branches in the event any of these branches are impacted by severe weather . COMPETITIONWe are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many financial services firms , including a number of larger securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering web-based financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONRJF is subject to the oversight and periodic examination of the Fed . RJ Bank is a national bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) , the Fed , the FDIC , and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) . Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory authorities which are discussed in the “ other regulations applicable to our operations ” portion of this section.The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our clients , customers , the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.The financial services industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws.10IndexNew rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act In July 2010 , the U.S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately ; however , the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies . Furthermore , many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to further rule making procedures and studies and will take effect over several years.The Dodd-Frank Act instructs U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rule-makings , studies and reports . These regulatory agencies include : the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( the “ CFTC ” ) ; the Securities and Exchange Commission ( the “ SEC ” ) ; the Fed ; the OCC ; the FDIC ; the CFPB ; and the Financial Stability Oversight Council ( the “ FSOC ” ) . As a result of Dodd-Frank Act rule-making and other regulatory reforms , we are currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct certain aspects of our business . Given that much of this regulatory development remains in a state of flux , we can not specifically quantify the potential impact that such regulations will have on our business and operations ( see Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . Some of the changes that have been enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act thus far include the following : •Since RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . In February 2011 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments . For banks with more than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation , which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail . This new rule became effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period . •In July 2011 , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under the following consumer protection laws : the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ; the Truth in Lending Act ; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ; Fair Credit Reporting Act ; Fair Debt Collection Act ; the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes . At the beginning of fiscal year 2014 , the CFPB assumed regulatory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with various federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment ; the majority of those became effective in early fiscal year 2014 . The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations , issue orders , draft policy statements , conduct examinations , and bring enforcement actions . The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws . Although the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain , it could result in changes to pricing , practices , products and procedures . It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight , supervision and examination , remediation efforts and possible penalties.•Moreover , in October 2012 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , the Fed , FDIC and OCC jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies , state member banks , and savings and loan companies with total assets between $ 10 billion and $ 50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests , report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed , and publish a summary of the results . Under the rules , stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios ( baseline , adverse , and severely adverse ) , which the Fed provides each year . RJF was required to conduct its first stress test by March 31 , 2014 . We submitted our initial stress testing results , utilizing data as of September 30 , 2013 , to the Fed on March 31 , 2014 . The Dodd-Frank Act also required that RJF begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results no later than June 30 , 2015 for the stress test cycle beginning on October 1 , 2014 . RJF publicly disclosed the required summary of its stress test results on June 29 , 2015 , in accordance with the abovementioned stress testing requirements.•The Volcker Rule : Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , Congress adopted the “ Volcker Rule , ” which generally prohibits , subject to exceptions , insured depository institutions , bank holding companies and their affiliates ( together , “ Banking Entities ” ) from engaging in “ proprietary trading ” or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund ( “ covered funds ” ) . In December 2013 , the CFTC , the OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC adopted a final version 11Indexof the Volcker Rule . Certain elements of the final rule provide for phasing-in over time . However , based upon our latest analysis and understandings of these regulations , we do not anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material impact on our results of operations . Nevertheless , due to its complexity and scope , we continue to review the details contained in the Volcker Rule to assess its impact on our operations.The Volcker Rule prohibits Banking Entities from engaging in proprietary trading , and imposes limitations on the extent to which Banking Entities are permitted to invest in certain “ covered funds ” ( e.g. , hedge funds and private equity funds , among others ) and requires that such investments be fully deducted from Tier 1 capital . “ Proprietary trading ” is defined as engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in the purchase or sale of a financial instrument . Under the Volcker Rule ’ s per-fund limits , a Banking Entity ’ s aggregate ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds can not exceed three percent of Tier 1 capital , although the impact of such limit to RJF ’ s investment portfolio is subject to further analysis . Additionally , Banking Entities engaged in proprietary trading and/or covered fund investments must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program . Congress provided an exemption for certain permitted activities of Banking Entities , such as underwriting , market making , hedging , and risk management.The Volcker Rule became effective as of April 1 , 2014 and all covered entities , including RJF , were required to conform to the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions on July 21 , 2015 ( the “ conformance period ” ) . However , on December 18 , 2014 , the Fed issued an order extending for an additional year the Volcker Rule conformance period for Banking Entities to conform their investments in and relationships with covered funds that may be subject to the Volcker Rule , and were in place prior to December 31 , 2014 ( “ Legacy Funds ” ) . The order also announced the Fed ’ s intention to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21 , 2017 . This extension , however , only applies to Legacy Funds . No extension was granted for the conformance period for proprietary trading activities . Banking Entities may still apply for an additional five-year extension for continued investments with respect to an illiquid fund . Such an extension will only be granted after a demonstration that the investment is necessary to fulfill a contractual commitment effective on May 1 , 2010 . We currently maintain a number of private equity investments , some of which meet the definition of “ covered funds ” and therefore are subject to certain limitations under the covered funds provisions of the Volcker Rule . The amount of future investments of this nature that we may make may be limited in order to maintain compliance levels specified by the Volcker Rule . Further , subsequent interpretations of what constitutes “ covered funds ” under the final Volcker Rule may adversely impact our operations . The recent extension of the conformance deadline provides us additional time to assess our holdings in the context of the new regulations and execute appropriate strategies to be in conformance with the Volcker Rule.•In July 2013 , the OCC , the Fed and the FDIC released final United States Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establishes a capital conservation buffer , and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The rule became effective for RJF on January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several aspects of the rule , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and certain regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . While we continue to evaluate the impact of these rules on both RJF and RJ Bank , based on our current analyses , we believe that both RJF and RJ Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules . However , the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for more information.•In July 2014 , the SEC adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds . The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds , while preserving the benefits of the funds . We do not sponsor any money market funds . We utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes , and offer to our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternatives.•In September 2013 , the SEC issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of “ municipal advisors ” as required under the Dodd-Frank Act . These rules , which became effective on July 1 , 2014 impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities , may result in the need for new written representations by issuers , and may limit the manner in which we , in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles , interact with municipal issuers . We registered as a municipal advisor with the SEC in 2014 ; by virtue of such registration our municipal finance business is now subject to additional regulation and oversight by the SEC . In August 2014 , the SEC also announced that it will undertake a two-year review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative . Moreover , forthcoming rulemaking 12Indexby the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local government are able to interact with outside finance professionals . These new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients , and may also have a negative short-term impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape . However , we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations ( which are included in our Capital Markets segment ) . Other regulations applicable to our operationsThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . The SEC recently adopted amendments , most of which were effective October 2013 , to its financial responsibility rules , including changes to the net capital rule , the customer protection rule , the record-keeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries . We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries ; however , based on our current analyses , we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to broker-dealers . Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Outside of the United States , we have additional offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America that are subject to local regulatory bodies in these territories.Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the United States and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) , the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry , subject to the approval of government agencies . These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . The SIPC was established under the Securities Investor Protection Act , and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor ’ s , and an “ AA- ” rating from Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC insurance is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund ( the “ Excess SIPC Insurer ” ) . For RJ & A , the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million for cash and securities , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per client for cash above basic SIPC coverage . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . RJF has provided an indemnity to the Excess SIPC Insurer against any and all losses they may incur associated with the excess SIPC insurance policies.During fiscal year 2015 , the Department of Labor ( the “ DOL ” ) proposed a new rule enhancing standards for individuals providing investment advice to retirement plans , their participants , or beneficiaries . We are continuing our study and evaluation of the proposal . The total impact of the standard , once finalized and implemented , on our business is unknown at this time.RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions , which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration , as well as by the SROs and IIROC.IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( the “ CIPF ” ) . The primary role of the CIPF is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian currency ( “ CDN ” ) per client , with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.13IndexSee Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation in the United States . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 , and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients.RJF is under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by the Fed . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC , the Fed , the FDIC and the CFPB . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business , including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates , and conduct and qualifications of personnel.RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ( the “ CRA ” ) . The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . Under the CRA , the federal banking agencies ( i.e. , the Fed , the FDIC and the OCC ) are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank a public CRA rating ( “ outstanding , ” “ satisfactory , ” “ needs to improve , ” or “ substantial noncompliance ” ) . Members of the public may submit comments on a bank ’ s performance , which will be considered as part of its performance evaluation . The results of the evaluation , together with the bank ’ s CRA rating , are also taken into consideration when evaluating mergers , acquisitions , and applications to open a branch or facility . RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA.Both RJF as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , are subject to various capital requirements . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory ( and possibly additional discretionary ) actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank . Under capital adequacy guidelines , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common equity Tier 1 , Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets , and Tier 1 capital to average assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Item 7 , “ Regulatory ” in this report and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K , for further information.14IndexEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTExecutive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) are as follows : Jennifer C.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees , and they involve risks , uncertainties and assumptions . Although we make such statements based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable , there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements . We caution investors not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements and urge you to carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” in this report . We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise.Item 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock or our senior notes which are listed on the NYSE . The list of risk factors provided below is not exhaustive ; there may be factors not discussed below or in this Form 10-K that adversely impact our results of operations , harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients , customers , investors and associates . If we fail to deal with , or appear to fail to deal with , issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money laundering , cybersecurity and privacy , recordkeeping , sales and trading practices , failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . A failure to maintain appropriate standards of service and quality , or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly , can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and harm to our reputation . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also harm our future business prospects . We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including levels of economic output , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . At times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including low levels of economic output , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , relatively high rates of unemployment , and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad . These 16Indexconditions led to several changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement , uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates , a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets , reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability . We could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting , financial advisory and other services , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers ’ and market participants ’ failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . These periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and , our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited . U.S. markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe and Russia . Concerns about the European Union ’ s ( “ EU ” ) sovereign debt in recent years , including the Greek government bailout , has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the EU ’ s financial support programs and the possibility exists that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these matters could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States , foreign governments , and domestic and international agencies . The Fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States . Fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . We may also be indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy enacted in various global markets.U.S . state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue or worsen , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and , in turn , reduce investment banking revenues . In addition , such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in North America . Market conditions in the United States and Canada can be assessed through the following metrics : the level and volatility of interest rates ; the rates of unemployment and under-employment ; real estate prices ; the level of consumer confidence ; changes in consumer spending ; and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity , or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment , spending , or to meet our contractual obligations , is essential to our business . Our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets for our company , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . The availability of outside financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on a variety of factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely 17Indexaffected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease to provide , funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties , as well as the stability of markets generally.If our credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our relationships with clients . Such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . We may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions ( see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for such information as of September 30 , 2015 ) . A credit downgrade would also result in RJF incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its $ 300 million revolving credit facility executed on August 6 , 2015 , in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade ( see Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Sources of Liquidity ” for information on this revolving credit facility ) .Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent , for the subsidiaries they supervise . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities , including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives , and venture capital and private equity investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing capital requirements , which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our venture capital and private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . 18IndexSee Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes , including bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , or operational failure , among others . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers market making and underwriting businesses , which exposes us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and/or resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits , as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels on a daily basis . A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged . In the case of aged securities failed to receive , we may , under industry regulations , purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of : C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities , among others . We incur credit risk through our investments , which include MBS , collateralized mortgage obligations , auction rate securities , and other municipal securities.Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to natural disasters , health emergencies or pandemics , acts of terrorism , severe weather events or other adverse economic events , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.19IndexOur business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries , and on advisory fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management ( “ AUM ” ) . AUM balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activities.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Furthermore , although we do not hold any EU sovereign debt , we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the EU sovereign debt circumstances . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Although we have not suffered any material or significant losses 20Indexas a result of the failure of any financial counterparty , any such losses in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.Our business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement , dated January 11 , 2012 , entered into by RJF and Regions , governing our acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( the “ SPA ” ) , Regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . Specifically , the terms of the SPA provide that Regions will indemnify RJF for losses incurred in connection with legal proceedings pending as of the closing date , April 2 , 2012 , or commenced thereafter and related to pre-closing matters that are received prior to April 2 , 2015 , as well as any cost of defense pertaining thereto . RJF is relying on Regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions , or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement , and any adverse judgments , and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the indemnification from Regions.Growth of our business could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses , or recruitment of financial advisors , or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . Moreover , to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions , we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms , or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business . Such acquisitions could be of significant size and/or complexity . This effort , together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business , could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions , which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage . Any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings , or perhaps at all . We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent 21Indexentrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms and hedge funds , among others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . The inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . In addition , we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology , including improvements made to internet connectivity , networking and telecommunications systems.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , particularly our managing directors , and the members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . The reputations and relationships of our senior professionals with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagement . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a new or existing competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us.We are exposed to operational risk.Our diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems , external events , including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center , operations processing sites or our branches . Our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets . The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards . It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our employees engage in misconduct , our businesses would be adversely affected . Operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption , system failures or failed transaction processing . Third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk , including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties . In addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services , we may not fully appreciate 22Indexor identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes . Increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations.Our existing business contingency plan is intended to ensure that we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets , including staff and technology , in the event of a systemic business interruption . Despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans , due to unforeseen factors , our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access , catastrophic events including weather related events , events involving electrical , environmental or communications malfunctions , as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry , and there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . If our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business . In addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected . Our businesses depend on technology.Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to : successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ; address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands ; and retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our technology systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions . The expectations of sound operational and informational security practices have risen among our clients and customers , the public at large and regulators . Thus , our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures , disruptions , cyberattacks and breakdowns . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches . However , there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future . Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations . Notwithstanding the precautions taken by us and measures put in place , if one or more of these events were to occur , this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain , including that of our clients and counterparties , which is processed , stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients and counterparties . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications . 23IndexWe may also be subject to litigation and financial losses that are neither insured nor covered under any of our current insurance policies . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.Extraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail entirely . While we have invested resources to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes , there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances . Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause , among other things , unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response times , resulting in client dissatisfaction due to transactions not being processed as quickly as desired.In providing services to clients , we may manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through system failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant . Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risks.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . Refer to the “ we are exposed to credit risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events , including weather events , could adversely impact RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . Refer to the “ we are exposed to operational risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how weather-related events could impact our ability to conduct business.We are exposed to litigation risks , which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability arising out of the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability . The failure of our advisors to fully understand investor needs or risk tolerances may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor . To the extent we fail to fully understand our clients or improperly advise them , we could be found liable for losses suffered by such clients , which could harm our business . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses . In highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for : alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions ; issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ’ investment objectives ; the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions ; contractual issues ; employment claims ; and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.24IndexWith regard to Morgan Keegan , a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition , that are received prior to April 2 , 2015 , are subject to indemnification from Regions . Refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled “ Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters ” for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnifications.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in the real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available for sale securities including Auction Rate Securities ( “ ARS ” ) , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means , which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective and , consequently , based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment , as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the “ FASB ” ) and the SEC have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 in this report , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.In December 2012 , the FASB issued a proposed standard on accounting for credit losses . The standard would replace multiple existing impairment models , including the replacement of the “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . The FASB announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard . We can not predict when a final standard will be issued , when it will be made effective , what its final provisions will encompass , or the potential impact its eventual adoption may have on our retained earnings . Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . While we utilize limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . 25IndexFurther , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts , all of which are under growing scrutiny by federal and state regulators in the United States . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions commonly known as emerging markets , and as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , less established regulatory regimes , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative , economic and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the abovementioned factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are generally smaller and less developed , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Additionally , a political , economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally.We have risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years , increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment , which will become even more stringent in light of recent well-publicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud . The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators , including the SEC , the Fed , the OCC and the CFPB , in addition to stock exchanges , FINRA and state attorneys general . Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and SROs . Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services , including , but not limited to , the authority to fine us and to grant , cancel , restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses . For example , the failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Exchange Act on broker-dealers and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 on investment advisers , including recordkeeping , advertising and operating requirements , disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities , 26Indexor by the Investment Company Act of 1940 ( the “ 1940 Act ” ) , could result in investigations , sanctions and reputational damage . We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC , other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or SROs ( e.g. , FINRA ) that supervise the financial markets . Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could harm our business prospects through adverse financial effects and reputational harm.Changes in regulations resulting from either the Dodd-Frank Act or any new regulations or laws may affect our businesses.The market and economic conditions over the past several years have directly led to a demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated , including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry ( see Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for a discussion of such changes , including the Volcker Rule ) . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy at large can not be specifically ascertained until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented . Nevertheless , it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of our assets , require us to alter at least some of our business practices , impose additional costs , and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations , and interact with regulators , all of which could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have or may impact our businesses include : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers ; regulatory oversight of incentive compensation ; the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading ; and restrictions on proprietary trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds established under the Dodd-Frank Act . These include , but are not limited to , RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . The CFPB has been active in investigating products , services , and operations of credit providers , including banks , for compliance with various consumer protection laws , such as the Truth in Lending Act , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Credit Reporting Act , and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act . Any actions taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make them less attractive , and restrict our ability to offer them , in addition to increasing our regulatory and compliance costs . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.In December 2013 , the final version of the Volcker Rule was adopted ( see Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report for discussion of the Volcker Rule ) and became effective April 1 , 2014 . We were required to comply with the Volcker Rule ’ s provisions starting on July 21 , 2015 . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading for our own trading account , due to our underwriting and market making activities , the Volcker Rule will likely adversely affect our results of operations through increased operational and compliance costs , possible reductions in our trading revenues , and changes to our principal capital private equity investments.The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitability.In July 2013 , the Fed , the OCC and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules , which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . These rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establish a capital conservation buffer , and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The regulatory capital rule became effective for us January 1 , 2015 , subject to a phase-in period for several of its provisions , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . The increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected . We continue to evaluate the impact of the capital rules on both RJ Bank and RJF.27IndexFailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators , and , accordingly , must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . The capital amounts and classification for both RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by U. S. federal regulators based on components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets , Tier 1 capital to average assets ( as defined in the regulations ) , and under rules defined in Basel III , Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and our financial condition.As more fully discussed in Item 1 , “ Regulation , ” in this report , RJF is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the Fed . While we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile , the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capital.Additionally , as RJF is a holding company , it depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations , including debt service . We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and FINRA ’ s net capital rule , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canada-based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by IIROC . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.We operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The securities industry is subject to extensive and constantly changing regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business , including , but not limited to , sales and trading methods , trade practices among broker-dealers , use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities , capital structure of securities firms , anti-money laundering efforts , recordkeeping , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . A violation of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to : civil and criminal liability ; sanctions , which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers ; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors ; censures ; fines ; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements , including the maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses . A failure to satisfy the risk-based regulatory capital levels could require us to halt certain activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 . However , due to our strong current capital position , we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” of Item 1 in this report for additional information.As a financial holding company , we are regulated by the Fed . RJ Bank is regulated by the OCC , the Fed , the CFPB , and the FDIC . This oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations . The economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased attention on the regulation of the financial services industry , including many proposals for new rules . Any new rules issued by U.S. regulators that oversee the financial services industry could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our 28Indexbusiness , financial condition , and results of operations . We also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state , or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act , with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The staff of the SEC ’ s Office of Compliance , Inspections and Examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to sub-transfer agents and sub-administrators for services that may be deemed to be distribution-related . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , their impact can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . Asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries , which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors , and broker-dealers . As some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC , increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs , or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations , or initiatives that may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business . For example , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for broker-dealers ; however , any such standard , if mandated , would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes , as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliance.In addition , the U.S. and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry , and may continue to take further actions , including expanding current or enacting new standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries . For example , several states and municipalities in the United States have recently adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees . Such “ pay-to-play ” rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business . Additionally , the use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may in the future be limited or modified . A substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars . This external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these additional costs . Furthermore , new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs . For example , many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund businesses or other businesses , and changes to the laws , rules and regulations in the United States related to the over-the-counter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration , recordkeeping and reporting obligations.See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” within Item 1 in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations.RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act and other U.S. federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . A successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties , injunctive relief , imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation.Item 1B .

RJ Bank originates and purchases commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , tax-exempt loans , as well as securities based loans ( “ SBL ” ) , all of which are funded primarily by cash balances swept from the investment accounts of our broker-dealer subsidiaries ’ clients . REPORTABLE SEGMENTSWe currently operate through five reportable segments : “ Private Client Group ” or “ PCG ” ; “ Capital Markets ” ; “ Asset Management ” ; RJ Bank and the “ Other ” segment.PRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide securities transaction and financial planning services to more than 2.5 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom ( “ UK ” ) through Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS ” ) . Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client ’ s level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . In fiscal year 2014 , the portion of securities commissions and fee revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include asset-based fees , trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products , mutual fund services fees , fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program , and interest income , and represented approximately 72 % of the Private Client Group ’ s total revenues . 3IndexRevenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration . As of September 30 , 2014 , client assets under administration of our Private Client Group amounted to approximately $ 451 billion.We offer investment advisory services under various financial advisor affiliation options . Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account , or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice . RJ & A advisors operate under the RJ & A registered investment advisor ( “ RIA ” ) license while independent contractors affiliated with RJFS may operate either under their own RIA license , or the RIA license of RJFSA . The investment advisory fee revenues associated with these activities are recorded within securities commissions and fee revenues on our consolidated financial statements . Refer to the securities commissions and fees section of our summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for our accounting policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements . The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Raymond James Insurance Group , Inc. ( “ RJIG ” ) . Through the financial advisors of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries , RJIG provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage . Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load mutual funds . RJ & A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers . Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by client balances , predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations , less interest paid on client cash balances ( the “ Client Interest Program ” ) . We also utilize a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue . The cash sweep program , known as the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , is a multi-bank ( RJ Bank and several non-affiliated banks ) program under which clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited into interest-bearing deposit accounts ( up to $ 250,000 per bank for individual accounts and up to $ 500,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This program enables clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) while earning competitive rates for their cash balances . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues.Clients ’ transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . RJ & A and RJ Ltd. make margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loan.Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ’ margin account borrowings . RJ & A ’ s source of funds to finance clients ’ margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ’ accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ’ funds derived from pledging and lending clients ’ securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ’ fully paid and excess margin securities.No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business.Raymond James & Associates RJ & A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ & A ’ s financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff .

RJIS also provides custodial and execution services to independent investment advisory firms.Securities LendingRJ & A conducts its securities lending business through the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties . Generally , we conduct these activities as an intermediary ( referred to as “ Matched Book ” ) . However , RJ & A will also loan client marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit ( referred to as lending from the “ Box ” ) to counterparties . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest . These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in the current market value of the underlying securities . Additionally , securities are borrowed from other broker-dealers ( referred to as borrowing for the “ Box ” ) to facilitate RJ & A ’ s clearance and settlement obligations . The net revenues of this securities lending business are the interest spreads generated . Operations and Information TechnologyRJ & A operations personnel are responsible for the processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , support of client accounts , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , and compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations through locations in Saint Petersburg , Florida , Denver , Colorado , Memphis , Tennessee and Southfield , Michigan . RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver , British Columbia.The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business . This platform is designed to allow our advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business.In the area of information security , we have developed and implemented a framework of principles , policies and technology to protect both our own information assets as well as those we have pertaining to our clients . Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of information resources.Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities . Business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and we have a staff which devotes their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced 5Indexand tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at our corporate office locations or one of our operations processing or data center sites . We have also developed a business continuity plan for our PCG retail branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather . RJ & A PCG offices utilize an integrated telephone system to route clients to a centralized support center that services clients directly in the event of a branch office closure . CAPITAL MARKETSCapital Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and services . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business . Institutional SalesInstitutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment ’ s revenue , which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities . Our institutional clients are serviced by institutional equity departments of RJ & A and RJ Ltd. ; the RJ & A fixed income department ; RJ & A ’ s European offices ; Raymond James Financial International , Ltd. , ( “ RJFI ” ) an institutional UK broker-dealer headquartered in London , England ; and Raymond James European Securities , Inc. , ( “ RJES ” ) headquartered in Paris , France . We charge commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.More than 115 domestic and overseas professionals located in offices in the U.S. and Europe comprise RJ & A ’ s institutional equity sales and sales trading departments and maintain relationships with nearly 1,430 institutional clients . Some European and U.S. offices also provide services to high net worth clients .

From offices in various locations within the U.S. , RJ & A distributes to institutional clients both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products , primarily municipal , corporate , government agency and mortgage-backed bonds . RJ & A carries inventory positions of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities . TradingRJ & A , and to a much lesser extent RJ Ltd. and RJFI , each trade both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income securities primarily for the purpose of facilitating sales to clients . The taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate , municipal , government , government agency , and mortgage-backed bonds , asset-backed securities , preferred stock , and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers . RJ & A enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “ to be announced ” securities ( e.g. , securities having a stated coupon and original term to maturity , although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction ) . Relatively small amounts of proprietary trading positions are also periodically taken by RJ & A or RJ Ltd. for various purposes and are closely monitored within well-defined limits . RJ & A , through its fixed income public finance operations , enters into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association ( “ GNMA ” ) , or Federal National Mortgage Association ( “ FNMA ” ) , mortgage back securities ( “ MBS ” ) . The MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies ( “ HFA ” ) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs . RJ & A ’ s forward GNMA or FNMA MBS purchase commitments arise at the time of the loan reservation for a borrower in the HFA lending program ( these loan reservations fix the terms of the mortgage , including the interest rate and maximum principal amount ) . The underlying terms of the GNMA or FNMA MBS purchase , including the price for the MBS security ( which is dependent upon the interest rates associated with the underlying mortgages ) are also fixed at loan reservation . Upon acquisition of the MBS security , RJ & A typically sells such security in open market transactions as part of its fixed income operations . RJ Capital Services , Inc. ( “ RJCS ” ) , a subsidiary of RJF , participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal , either to economically hedge RJ & A fixed income inventory , for transactions with clients , or to a limited extent for its own account . RJCS also purchases pools of interest-only SBA loan strips ( “ I/O Strips ” ) that result from RJ Bank ’ s SBA loan purchase and securitization process , and sells these I/O Strips as part of our fixed income operations.Trading equity securities involves the purchase and sale of securities from and to our clients or other dealers . Trading profits and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices , as well as the change in market prices for the individual securities during the period we hold them . Similar to the equity research department described in the following section , this 6Indexoperation serves to support both our institutional equity capital markets and Private Client Group sales efforts . RJ & A also offers an options trading platform that is operated primarily on an agency basis . The RJ Ltd. trading desks not only support client activity , but also take proprietary positions that are closely monitored within well-defined limits . RJ Ltd. also provides specialist services in approximately 160 TSX listed common stocks .

For every derivative transaction RJSS enters into with a client , RJSS enters into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution . Thus , we refer to RJSS ’ s operations as our “ matched book ” derivatives business.SyndicateThe syndicate department consists of professionals who coordinate the marketing , distribution , pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings . In addition to lead and co-managed offerings , this department coordinates the firm ’ s syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms.Raymond James Tax Credit Funds , Inc.Raymond James Tax Credit Funds , Inc.

RJTCF has been an active participant in the tax credit program since its inception in 1986 and currently focuses on tax credit funds for institutional investors that invest in a portfolio of tax credit-eligible multi-family apartments . The investors ’ expected returns on their investments in these funds are primarily derived from tax credits and tax losses that investors can use to reduce their federal tax liability . During fiscal year 2014 , RJTCF invested nearly $ 665 million for large institutional investors in more than 80 real estate transactions for properties located throughout the U.S . Since inception , RJTCF has sold , inclusive of unfunded commitments , over $ 5.4 billion of tax credit fund partnership interests and has sponsored nearly 100 tax credit funds , with investments in over 1,650 tax credit apartment properties in nearly all 50 states and one U.S. Territory.7IndexEmerging MarketsRaymond James International Holdings , Inc. ( “ RJIH ” ) , through its subsidiaries , currently has interests in operations in Latin American countries including Argentina and Uruguay . Through these entities we operate securities brokerage , investment banking , asset management and equity research businesses.ASSET MANAGEMENTOur Asset Management segment includes the operations of Eagle , the Eagle Family of Funds ( “ Eagle Funds ” ) , the asset management operations of RJ & A ( “ AMS ” ) , Raymond James Trust , National Association ( “ RJ Trust ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF , and other fee-based programs . Revenues for this segment are primarily generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services provided for individual and institutional investment portfolios , along with mutual funds . Investment advisory fees are earned on assets held in managed or non-discretionary asset-based programs . These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter , the end of the quarter , or average daily assets . Consistent with industry practice , fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period . Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds . Rising markets have historically had a positive impact on investment advisory fee revenues as existing accounts increase in value , and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business.Eagle Asset Management , Inc.Eagle is a registered investment advisor that offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and subsidiary investment advisors , including Eagle Boston Investment Management , Inc. ( “ EBIM ” ) and ClariVest Asset Management , LLC ( “ ClariVest ” ) . Eagle and its subsidiaries have approximately $ 28.8 billion in assets under management and approximately $ 2.4 billion in assets under advisement ( non-discretionary advised assets ) as of September 30 , 2014 . Eagle ’ s clients include institutions , corporations , pension and profit sharing plans , foundations , endowments , issuers of variable annuities , individuals and mutual funds . Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Funds . Most clients are charged fees based upon asset levels including fees on non-discretionary assets for providing Eagle account models to professional advisors at other firms , however in some cases performance fees may be earned for outperforming respective benchmarks . Eagle Fund Distributors , Inc. ( “ EFD ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle , is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Funds.The Small Cap Growth Fund , Mid Cap Growth Fund , Growth and Income Fund , Small Cap Stock Fund , Mid Cap Stock Fund , and Investment Grade Bond Fund are managed by Eagle . The Capital Appreciation Fund and International Stock Fund utilize ClariVest as a sub-advisor , and the Eagle Smaller Company Fund is managed by EBIM.Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle Funds through an unrelated third party.AMSAMS provides a range of offerings to our PCG clients including : managing several investment advisory programs which maintain an approved list of investment managers , provide asset allocation model portfolios , establish custodial facilities , monitor the performance of client accounts , provide clients with accounting and other administrative services , and assist investment managers with certain trading management activities . One of AMS ’ programs , “ Raymond James Consulting Services ” is a managed program in which Raymond James Consulting Services serves as a conduit for AMS clients to access a number of independent investment managers , in addition to Eagle , with initial investment amounts that are below normal program minimums , as well as providing monitoring and due diligence services . AMS earns fees on asset balances , a portion of which are paid to predominately independent investment managers and Eagle and affiliates who direct the investments within clients ’ accounts . In addition , AMS offers additional accounts managed within fee based asset allocation platforms under our program known as Freedom , and other managed programs . Freedom ’ s investment committee manages portfolios of mutual funds , exchange traded funds and separately managed account models on a discretionary basis . For separately managed account models a portion of the fees earned may be paid to the investment managers who provide the models . At September 30 , 2014 , these managed programs had approximately $ 40.6 billion in assets under management , including approximately $ 4.8 billion managed by Eagle and affiliates.8IndexAMS also provides certain services for their non-discretionary asset-based programs ( known as Passport , Ambassador or other non-discretionary asset-based programs ) . AMS provides performance reporting , research , sales , accounting , trading and other administrative services . Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors . Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts . The revenues are predominantly included in securities commissions and fees revenue in the PCG segment , with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities included in investment advisory fee revenue in this Asset Management segment . As of September 30 , 2014 , these programs had approximately $ 78.9 billion in assets . RJFS and RJFSA offer a similar fee-based program known as IMPAC ( “ IMPAC ” ) . All revenues for IMPAC are reported in the PCG segment . As of September 30 , 2014 , IMPAC had approximately $ 12.8 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors and RJFSA registered investment advisors ( see the Private Client Group segment discussion in this Item 1 for additional information ) . In addition to the foregoing programs , AMS also administers managed fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James Consulting Services program.Raymond James Trust , National AssociationRJ Trust is a nationally chartered trust company regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) , that has been serving the clients of our financial advisors since 1991 . With nearly 90 trust associates and six offices across the U.S. , RJ Trust administers approximately $ 3.4 billion in personal and charitable trust assets as of September 30 , 2014 , which includes $ 247 million in the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund . The Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund is a certified 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) public charity where RJ Trust serves as trustee.In addition to acting as a sole-trustee or co-trustee , under its federal charter RJ Trust may also act as custodian , personal representative or agent for trustee in a wide variety of trust and estate situations in all 50 states . RJ Trust also serves as trustee in living trusts , charitable trusts , life insurance trusts , specialty trusts , Individual Retirement Account ( “ IRA ” ) rollover trusts and others . RJ BANKRJ Bank is a national bank regulated by the OCC that provides corporate , SBL and residential loans , as well as FDIC insured deposit accounts , to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank ’ s net interest earnings . RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to RJF ’ s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank ’ s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include C & I loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , tax-exempt loans , as well as loans fully collateralized by marketable securities . Corporate loans represent approximately 75 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio of which 95 % are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank ’ s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts maintained at RJ & A . RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer ( see table of industry concentration in Item 7A , “ Credit Risk ” in this report ) .OTHERThis segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities as well as various corporate overhead costs of RJF including the interest cost on our public debt , and the acquisition and integration costs associated with our acquisitions including , most significantly in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , Morgan Keegan ( as hereinafter defined below , see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding this acquisition ) . Our principal capital and private equity activities include various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments ; employee investment funds ( the “ Employee Funds ” ) ; and various private equity funds which we sponsor . 9IndexWe participate in profits or losses from various investments through both general and limited partnership interests . Additionally , we realize profits or incur losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments . The Employee Funds are limited partnerships , some of which we are the general partner , that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships . The Employee Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees . As of September 30 , 2014 , certain of our merchant banking investments include investments in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies , an event photography business , and a company pursuing a new concept in the salon services market.On April 2 , 2012 ( the “ Closing Date ” ) , RJF completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan & Company , Inc. ( “ MK & Co. ” ) , and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to hereinafter as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) . In mid-February 2013 , we completed the transfer of all of the active businesses of MK & Co. to RJ & A . At the time of its acquisition , MK & Co. was a clearing broker-dealer , headquartered in Memphis , Tennessee . After the transfers of its businesses to RJ & A and effective September 2013 , MK & Co. became a special purpose broker-dealer . In July 2013 , MK & Co. formally changed its legal form from a corporation to a limited liability company , and is now known as Morgan Keegan & Company , LLC . MK & Co. has had no operations throughout fiscal year 2014.COMPETITIONWe are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONThe following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our clients , customers , the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . New rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act In July 2010 , the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately ; however the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies . Furthermore , many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to further rule making procedures and studies and will take effect over several years . The Dodd-Frank Act instructs U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rule-makings , studies and reports . These regulatory agencies include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ; the SEC ; the Fed ; the OCC ; the FDIC ; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( the “ CFPB ” ) ; and the Financial Stability Oversight Council ( the “ FSOC ” ) . As 10Indexa result of Dodd-Frank Act rule-making and other regulatory reforms , we are currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct certain aspects of our business . Given the current status of the regulatory developments , we can not currently quantify the possible effects on our business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway ( see Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations ) . Certain of the changes enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act thus far , include the following : •Since RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . In February 2011 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments . For banks with more than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation , which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail . This new rule became effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period . •In July 2011 , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under such laws as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Truth in Lending Act , Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act , Fair Credit Reporting Act , Fair Debt Collection Act , the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes . At the beginning of fiscal year 2014 , the CFPB assumed regulatory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with various federal consumer protection laws . The CFPB has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment ; the majority of those became effective in early fiscal year 2014 . The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations and issue orders , policy statements , conduct examinations , and bring enforcement actions . The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws . The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing , practices , products and procedures . It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight , supervision and examination , remediation efforts and possible penalties.•In October 2012 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , regulators issued final rules requiring banking organizations with total assets of more than $ 10 billion but less than $ 50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests , report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed and publish a summary of the results . Under the rules , stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios ( baseline , adverse , and severely adverse ) , which the Fed provides each year . These new rules required RJF to conduct its first stress test by March 31 , 2014 . We submitted our initial stress testing results , utilizing data as of September 30 , 2013 , to the Federal Reserve Board ( “ FRB ” ) on March 31 , 2014 . In addition , RJF will be required to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results no later than June 30 , 2015 for the stress test cycle beginning on October 1 , 2014.•The Volcker Rule : Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , Congress adopted a ban on proprietary trading and restricted investment in hedge funds and private equity funds by commercial banks and their affiliates ( the “ Regulated Entities ” ) , the so-called “ Volcker Rule. ” In December 2013 , the CFTC , the OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC adopted a final version of the Volcker Rule . We continue to review the details contained in the final Volcker Rule to assess its impact on our operations . Based upon our latest analysis and understandings of these regulations , we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our results of operations . The final Volcker Rule prohibits Regulated Entities from engaging in “ proprietary trading ” and imposes limitations on the extent to which Regulated Entities are permitted to invest in certain “ covered funds ” ( i.e . hedge funds and private equity funds ) and requires that such investments be fully deducted from Tier 1 Capital . It limits a Regulated Entity ’ s aggregate ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds to three percent of Tier I capital , although the impact of such limit to RJF ’ s investment portfolio is subject to further analysis . Additionally , Regulated Entities are prohibited from owning three percent or more of any single fund . Congress provided an exemption for certain permitted activities of Regulated Entities , such as underwriting , market making , hedging , and risk management.The final Volcker Rules became effective as of April 1 , 2014 and conformance is required by July 21 , 2015 . However , the conformance period may be subject to two additional one-year extensions by the Fed . Furthermore , Regulated Entities can apply for an additional five-year extension for certain qualifying investments . We currently maintain investments in selected private equity and merchant banking entities , some of which may meet the definition of “ covered funds ” and therefore be subject to certain limitations . The amount of future investments of this nature that we may make may be 11Indexlimited in order to maintain compliance levels specified by the regulation . Further , subsequent interpretations of what constitutes “ covered funds ” under the final Volcker Rule may adversely impact our operations . •In July 2013 , the OCC , the FRB , and the FDIC released final United States Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establishes a capital conservation buffer , and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The rule becomes effective for us on January 1 , 2015 , subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both RJF and RJ Bank ; however , based on our current analyses , we believe that RJF and RJ Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules . However , the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this report for more information.•In July 2014 , the SEC adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds . The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdraws over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds , while preserving the benefits of the funds . We do not sponsor any money market funds . We utilize such funds to a small extent for our own investment purposes , and offer to our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternatives.•Effective July 1 , 2014 , certain final rules issued by the SEC regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors became effective . These rules specify which activities will be covered by the Dodd-Frank Act imposed fiduciary duty of a municipal advisor to its government client , may result in the need for new written representations by issuers , and may limit the manner in which we , in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles , interact with municipal issuers . We registered as a municipal advisor and by virtue of such registration are now subject to additional regulation and oversight in respect of our municipal finance business . The SEC recently announced that it will undertake a two-year review of municipal advisors . Additionally , forthcoming rulemaking by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local government are able to interact with the outside finance professionals . Although these new rules impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients , and may have a negative short-term impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry adapts to the new rules , we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations ( which are included in our Capital Markets segment ) . Other regulations applicable to our operationsThe SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . The SEC recently adopted amendments , most of which were effective October 2013 , to its financial responsibility rules , including changes to the net capital rule , the customer protection rule , the record-keeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries . We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries ; however , based on our current analyses , we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to broker-dealers . Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America.Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to be members of SIPC . The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $ 500,000 per client , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating 12Indexfrom Standard and Poor ’ s and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund ( “ Excess SIPC Insurer ” ) . For RJ & A , the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million for cash and securities , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per client for cash above basic SIPC . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . RJF has provided an indemnity to the Excess SIPC Insurer against any and all losses they may incur associated with the excess SIPC policies.RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC.RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian currency ( “ CDN ” ) per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . RJF is under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by the Fed . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC , the Fed , the FDIC and the CFPB . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel . RJ Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act ( “ CRA ” ) . The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas , including low and moderate income neighborhoods , consistent with safe and sound bank operations . The regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating . These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers , acquisitions , and applications to open a branch or facility . Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on RJ Bank.RJF as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , are subject to various capital requirements . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory , and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on our and RJ Bank ’ s financial results . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF ’ s and RJ Bank ’ s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Item 7 , “ Regulatory ” in this report and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K , for further information.13IndexEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTExecutive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

A failure to maintain appropriate standards of service and quality , or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly , can result in client dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and harm to our reputation . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also harm our future business prospects . We are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including levels of economic output , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including trading levels , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . 15IndexAt times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including low levels of economic output , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , relatively high rates of unemployment , and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad . These conditions led to several factors in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While select factors indicate signs of improvement , uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates , a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets , reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability . We could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting , financial advisory and other services , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers ’ and market participants ’ failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . These periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and , our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited . U.S. markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe and Russia . Concerns about the European Union ’ s ( “ EU ” ) sovereign debt in recent years has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the EU ’ s financial support programs and the possibility exists that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these matters could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States , foreign governments , and domestic and international agencies . The Fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States . Fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . We may also be indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy enacted in various global markets.U.S . state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment , and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue or worsen , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues . In addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in North America . United States and/or Canadian factors which are indicative of market conditions include : interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity , or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment , spending , or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business . Our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets for our company , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . The availability of outside financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on a variety of factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely 16Indexaffected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease , to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally , and the strength of counterparties specifically.If RJF ’ s credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our relationships with clients . Such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . We may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in one of our credit agreements and certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions ( see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for such information as of September 30 , 2014 ) . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC ( through FINRA ) have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent , for the subsidiaries they supervise . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives , and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results , financial condition and liquidity.Our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.17IndexWe are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealers market making and underwriting businesses exposing us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities , loans and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged . In the case of aged securities failed to receive , we may , under industry regulations , purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , could result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including , but not limited to , C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , tax-exempt loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities . We incur credit risk through our investments which include MBS , collateralized mortgage obligations , auction rate securities , and other municipal securities.Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to a natural disaster , act of terrorism , severe weather event , or economic event , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . Declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products , fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and on advisory fees.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly 18Indexaffect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . Assets under management balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold primarily in connection with our market making or underwriting activities.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Furthermore , although we do not hold any EU sovereign debt , we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the EU sovereign debt circumstances . Defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty , any such losses in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.19IndexWe have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.Our business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement dated January 11 , 2012 entered into by RJF and Regions governing our acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( the “ SPA ” ) , Regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . RJF is relying on Regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions , or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding these indemnification agreements.Growth of our business could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses , or recruitment of financial advisors , or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . Moreover , to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions , we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms , or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business . Such acquisitions could be of significant size and/or complexity . This effort , together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business , could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions , which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage . Any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings , or perhaps at all . We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms , hedge funds , and others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . In addition , the continued development of internet , networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes 20Indexcould require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure . An inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Our ability to attract and retain senior professionals , qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals , particularly our managing directors , and the members of our executive committees , as well as employees and financial advisors . To compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified professionals , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . The reputations and relationships of our senior professionals with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagement . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.Turnover in the financial services industry is high . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel . If we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers , senior equity research , sales and trading professionals , asset managers , or executive officers to a new or existing competitor or otherwise , we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services . If we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals , our reputation , business , results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected . Further , new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us.We are exposed to operational risk.Our diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems , external events , including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center , operations processing sites or our branches . Our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets . The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards . It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our employees engage in misconduct , our businesses would be adversely affected . Operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption , system failures or failed transaction processing . Third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk , including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties . In addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services , we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes . Increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations.Our business contingency plan in place is intended to ensure we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets , including staff and technology , in the event of a business interruption . Despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans , due to unforeseen factors , our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access , catastrophic events including weather related events , events involving 21Indexelectrical , environmental or communications malfunctions , as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . Associate misconduct , which is difficult to detect and deter , could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.There have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry , and there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . For example , our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients . If our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients , we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation , financial position , current client relationships and ability to attract future clients . We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business . In addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity , providing financial planning , investment advice and discretionary asset management . The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us . It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our associates engage in misconduct , our business would be adversely affected . Our businesses depend on technology.Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands , and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other laws , and regulatory sanctions . Client and customer , public , and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased . Thus , our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures , disruptions and breakdowns . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , to-date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches , however , there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future . Notwithstanding that we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our , or our clients ’ or counterparties ’ , confidential and other information processed , stored in , and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.Extraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . While we have made investments to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes , there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances . Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause , among other things , unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire , resulting in client dissatisfaction.22IndexIn providing services to clients , we may manage , utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data , including personal data . As a result , we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information , such as the U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws . These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number . If any person , including any of our associates , negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data , or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data , we could be subject to significant monetary damages , regulatory enforcement actions , fines and/or criminal prosecution . In addition , unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data , whether through systems failure , employee negligence , fraud or misappropriation , could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future . Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant and depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach , this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing these types of operational risk.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and our information systems processing is conducted out of our new information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area ( see Item 2 , “ Properties ” in this report for further discussion ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . Refer to the “ we are exposed to credit risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events , including weather events , could adversely impact RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio and the “ we are exposed to operational risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A , for a discussion of how weather related events could impact our ability to conduct business.We are exposed to litigation risks.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising in the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability for us . Advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances . Such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor . To the extent we fail to know our clients or improperly advise them , we could be found liable for losses suffered by such clients , which could harm our business . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . In highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ’ investment objectives , the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.As it pertains to Morgan Keegan , a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition are subject to indemnification from Regions . Refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled , “ Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters ” for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnifications.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.23IndexThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available for sale securities including Auction Rate Securities ( “ ARS ” ) , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 in this report , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , in this Form 10-K.In December , 2012 the FASB issued a proposed standard on accounting for credit losses . The standard would replace multiple existing impairment models , including replacing an “ incurred loss ” model for loans with an “ expected loss ” model . The FASB announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard . We can not predict whether or when a final standard will be issued , when it will be effective , what its final provisions will be , or the potential impact its eventual adoption may have on our retained earnings . Our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . While we employ limits and other risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , 24Indexthe willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and , as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and/or our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Additionally , a political , economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally.We have risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTFinancial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years , increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment which we expect will become even more stringent in light of recent well-publicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud . The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators , including the SEC , the NYSE , FINRA , the OCC , the CFPB , the Fed , and state attorneys general . Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years . We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations . Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services , including , but not limited to , the authority to fine us and to grant , cancel , restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to carry on particular businesses . For example , a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Exchange Act on broker-dealers and the Investment Advisers Act on investment advisers , including record-keeping , advertising and operating requirements , disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities , or by the Investment Company Act of 1940 , could result in investigations , sanctions and reputational damage . We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC , other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets . Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have adverse financial effects on us or cause reputational harm to us , which could harm our business prospects.Changes in regulations resulting from either the Dodd-Frank Act or any new regulations may affect our businesses.The market and economic conditions over the past several years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry , including significant additional legislation and regulation in the 25IndexU.S . and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry ( see Item 1 , Regulation , in this report for a discussion of such changes including the Volcker Rule ) . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy can not be known until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and implemented . These legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue , limit our ability to pursue business opportunities , impact the value of assets that we hold , require us to change certain of our business practices , impose additional costs on us , or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations and interact with regulators , all of which while not currently anticipated to , could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have or may impact our business include , but are not limited to : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers , regulatory oversight of incentive compensation , the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act . These include but are not limited to RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB . The CFPB has been active in investigating products , services and operations of credit providers , including banks , for compliance with various laws such as the Truth in Lending Act , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Credit Reporting Act , and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act . Any actions taken by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services , make them less attractive , restrict our ability to offer them , or increase our regulatory and compliance costs . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.In December , 2013 , the final version of the Volcker Rule was adopted ( see Item 1 , Regulation , in this report for discussion of the Volcker Rule ) . Although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of trading for our own account , due to our underwriting and market making activities , the Volcker Rule will likely increase our operational and compliance costs , and may reduce our trading revenues , require a change in our principal capital private equity investments , and as a result adversely affect our results of operations.The SEC recently adopted amendments , most of which were effective October , 2013 , to its financial responsibility rules , including changes to the net capital rule , the customer protection rule , the record-keeping rules , and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries . We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Such impact could have an adverse effect on certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitability.In July 2013 , the OCC , the FRB and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establishes a capital conservation buffer , and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The rule becomes effective for us January 1 , 2015 , subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both RJ Bank and RJF . The increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected.Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF ’ s and RJ Bank ’ s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital , risk-weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and our financial condition.26IndexAs more fully discussed in Item 1 , Regulation , in this report , RJF is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the Fed . While we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile , the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capital.Additionally , as RJF is a holding company , it depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including , among others , debt service . We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and the net capital rule of FINRA , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canada based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.We operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including , but not limited to , sales and trading methods , trade practices among broker-dealers , use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities , capital structure of securities firms , anti-money laundering efforts , record keeping and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . If laws or regulations are violated , we could be subject to one or more of the following : civil liability , criminal liability , sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements including the maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses . However , due to our strong current capital position , we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” of Item 1 in this report for additional information.As a financial holding company , we are regulated by the Fed . RJ Bank is regulated by the OCC , the Fed , the CFPB , and the FDIC . This oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations . The economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry , including many proposals for new rules . Any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . We also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state , or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The staff of the Office of Compliance , Inspections and Examinations has indicated that it is reviewing use of fund assets to pay for fees to sub-transfer agents and sub-administrators for services that may be deemed to be distribution-related . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , the impact of changes such as those currently proposed can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . Asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds , investment advisors and broker-dealers . Some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business , and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities . It is impossible 27Indexto determine the extent of the impact of any new laws , regulations or initiatives that may be proposed , or whether any of the proposals will become law . Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors . It is not clear whether the SEC will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to broker-dealers ; however , any such standard , if mandated , would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and result in changes to these , and require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliance.In addition , in recent years , the U.S. and other governments have taken actions , and may continue to take further actions , including expanding current or enacting new standards , requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries and in particular our investment management business . For example , several states and municipalities in the United States have recently adopted “ pay-to-play ” rules , which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees , and could therefore affect the profitability of that portion of our business . In addition , the use of “ soft dollars , ” where a portion of commissions paid to broker-dealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors , is periodically reexamined and may in the future be limited or modified . Although a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts , external research , including external research paid for with soft dollars , is important to the process . This external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes , and includes broker-provided research , as well as third party provided databases and research services . If the use of soft dollars is limited , we may have to bear some of these costs . Furthermore , new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs . For example , many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund businesses or other businesses , and changes to the laws , rules and regulations in the U.S. related to the over-the-counter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration , recordkeeping and reporting obligations.See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” within Item 1 in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations.RJ Bank is subject to the CRA and fair lending laws , and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties.The CRA , the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , the Fair Housing Act , and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions . The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies , including the CFPB , are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations . A successful challenge to an institution ’ s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions , including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties , injunctive relief , imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity , and restrictions on expansion activity . Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution ’ s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.Item 1B . UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable."

( “ RJF ” ) , the parent company of a business established in 1962 and a public company since 1983 , is a financial holding company headquartered in St. Petersburg , Florida whose subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses predominantly in the United States of America ( “ U.S. ” ) and Canada . At September 30 , 2013 , its principal subsidiaries include Raymond James & Associates , Inc. ( “ RJ & A ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services , Inc. ( “ RJFS ” ) , Raymond James Financial Services Advisors , Inc. ( “ RJFSA ” ) , Raymond James Ltd. ( “ RJ Ltd. ” ) , Eagle Asset Management , Inc. ( “ Eagle ” ) , and Raymond James Bank , N.A . ( “ RJ Bank ” ) . All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF . RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “ our , ” “ we ” or “ us. ” As a financial holding company , RJF is subject to the oversight and periodic examination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ Fed ” ) . PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIESOur principal subsidiary , RJ & A , with approximately 350 traditional branch and satellite offices throughout the U.S , is the largest full service brokerage and investment firm headquartered in the state of Florida and is one of the largest retail brokerage firms in the country . RJ & A is a self-clearing broker-dealer engaged in most aspects of securities distribution , trading , investment banking and asset management . RJ & A also offers financial planning services for individuals and provides clearing services for RJFS , RJFSA , other affiliated entities and several unaffiliated broker-dealers . In addition , RJ & A has seven institutional sales offices in Europe . RJ & A is a member of the New York Stock Exchange Euronext ( “ NYSE ” ) and most regional exchanges in the U.S . It is also a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( “ FINRA ” ) and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ( “ SIPC ” ) . In mid-February 2013 , we completed the transfer of all of the active businesses of Morgan Keegan & Company , Inc. ( “ MK & Co. ” ) to RJ & A . At the time of its acquisition , MK & Co. was a clearing broker-dealer , headquartered in Memphis , Tennessee . After the transfers of its businesses to RJ & A and effective September 2013 , MK & Co. became a special purpose broker-dealer . In the prior year on April 2 , 2012 ( the “ Closing Date ” ) , RJF completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of MK & Co. , and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to hereinafter as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) . In July 2013 , MK & Co. formally changed its legal form from a corporation to a limited liability company , and is now known as Morgan Keegan & Company , LLC . RJFS is one of the largest independent contractor brokerage firms in the U.S. , is a member of FINRA and SIPC , but is not a member of any exchanges . Financial advisors affiliated with RJFS may offer their clients all products and services offered through RJ & A including investment advisory products and services which are offered through its affiliated registered investment advisor , RJFSA . Both RJFS and RJFSA clear all of their business on a fully disclosed basis through RJ & A.RJ Ltd. is our Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary which engages in both retail and institutional distribution and investment banking . RJ Ltd. is a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange ( “ TSX ” ) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) . Its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of FINRA and SIPC.Eagle is a registered investment advisor serving as the discretionary manager for individual and institutional equity and fixed income portfolios and our internally sponsored mutual funds . RJ Bank originates and purchases commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , as well as consumer loans , all of which are funded primarily by cash balances swept from the investment accounts of our broker-dealer subsidiaries ’ clients . REPORTABLE SEGMENTSEffective September 30 , 2013 we have five reportable segments : “ Private Client Group ” or “ PCG ” ; “ Capital Markets ” ; “ Asset Management ” ; RJ Bank and the “ Other ” segment . We implemented changes in our reportable segments as a result of management ’ s assessment of the usefulness and materiality of certain of our historic reportable segments . The result of the changes we implemented is the combination of the Private Client Group and the historic securities lending segments , the Capital Markets and the historic emerging markets segments , and the Other and the historic proprietary capital segments . Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended on September 30 , 2013 , 2012 , 2011 respectively , have been presented as if the change had been in effect throughout each year . See Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.3IndexPRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately 2.5 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom ( “ UK ” ) through Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS ” ) . Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client ’ s level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . In fiscal year 2013 , the portion of securities commissions and fee revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include asset-based fees , trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products , mutual fund services fees , fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program , and interest income , and represented approximately 68 % of the Private Client Group ’ s total revenues . Revenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration . As of September 30 , 2013 , client assets under administration of our Private Client Group amounted to approximately $ 403 billion.RJ & A , RJFS and RJFSA offer investment advisory services under various financial advisor affiliation options . Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account , or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice . RJ & A advisors operate under the RJ & A registered investment advisor ( “ RIA ” ) license while independent contractors affiliated with RJFS may operate either under their own RIA license , or the RIA license of RJFSA . The investment advisory fee revenues associated with these activities are recorded within securities commissions and fee revenues on our consolidated financial statements . Refer to the securities commissions and fees section of our summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for our accounting policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements . The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency which was at one time known as Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJF . In October 2013 , PCA merged with another wholly owned subsidiary of RJF , and PCA , as the surviving entity , changed its name to Raymond James Insurance Group , Inc. ( “ RJIG ” ) . Through the financial advisors of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries , RJIG provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage . Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load mutual funds . RJ & A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers . Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances , predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations , less interest paid on customer cash balances ( “ Client Interest Program ” ) . We also utilize a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue . The cash sweep program , known as the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , is a multi-bank ( RJ Bank and several non-affiliated banks ) program under which clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third party service into interest-bearing deposit accounts ( up to $ 250,000 per bank for individual accounts and up to $ 500,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This program enables clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) while earning competitive rates for their cash balances . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues.Clients ’ transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . RJ & A and RJ Ltd. make margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loan.4IndexTypically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ’ margin account borrowings . RJ & A ’ s source of funds to finance clients ’ margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ’ accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ’ funds derived from pledging and lending clients ’ securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ’ fully paid and excess margin securities.No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business.Raymond James & Associates RJ & A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ & A ’ s financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff . The number of financial advisors per office ranges from one to 46 . RJ & A financial advisors are employees and their compensation includes commission payments and participation in the firm ’ s benefit plans . Experienced financial advisors are hired from a wide variety of competitors .

Revenues for this segment are primarily generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services provided for individual and institutional investment portfolios , along with mutual funds . Investment advisory fees are earned on assets held in managed or non-managed programs . These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter , the end of the quarter , or average daily assets . Consistent with industry practice , fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period . Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds . Rising markets have historically had a positive impact on investment advisory fee revenues as existing accounts increase in value , and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business.Eagle Asset Management , Inc.Eagle is a registered investment advisor that offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and subsidiary investment advisors , including Eagle Boston Investment Management , Inc. and ClariVest Asset Management ( “ ClariVest ” ) .

One of AMS ’ programs , “ Raymond James Consulting Services ” is a managed program in which Raymond James Consulting Services serves as a conduit for AMS clients to access a number of independent investment managers , in addition to Eagle , with initial investment amounts that are below normal program minimums , as well as providing monitoring and due diligence services .

In addition , AMS offers additional accounts managed within fee based asset allocation platforms under our program known as Freedom , and other managed programs . Freedom ’ s investment committee manages portfolios of mutual funds , exchange traded funds and separately managed account models on a discretionary basis . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.10 % to 0.50 % of these asset balances per annum . For separately managed account models a portion of the fee may be paid to the investment managers who provide the models . At September 30 , 2013 , these managed programs had approximately $ 33 billion in assets under management , including approximately $ 5 billion managed by Eagle.AMS also provides certain services for their non-managed fee-based programs ( known as Passport , Ambassador or other non-managed programs ) . AMS provides performance reporting , research , sales , accounting , trading and other administrative services . Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors . Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts . Total client fees generally range from 1.0 % to 2.5 % of assets , and the revenues are predominantly included in securities commissions and fees revenue in the PCG segment , with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities included in investment advisory fee revenue in this Asset Management segment . As of September 30 , 2013 , these programs had approximately $ 63 billion in assets . RJFS and RJFSA offer a similar fee-based program known as IMPAC ( “ IMPAC ” ) . All revenues for IMPAC are reported in the PCG segment .

See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank ’ s net interest earnings . RJ Bank is a national bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) . During fiscal year 2012 , RJ Bank converted from a thrift charter to a national bank charter to facilitate RJ Bank maintaining a loan portfolio with a greater percentage of corporate loans than were otherwise permissible under thrift regulations . 9IndexRJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to RJF ’ s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank ’ s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services .

As of September 30 , 2013 , certain of our merchant banking investments include investments in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies , an event photography business , and a company pursuing a new concept in the salon services market.COMPETITIONWe are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONThe following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.10IndexThe financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . During our fiscal year 2010 , the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . Because of the nature of our business and our business practices , we presently do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole . However , because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies , the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . The SEC recently adopted amendments , most of which were effective October , 2013 , to its financial responsibility rules , including changes to the net capital rule , the customer protection rule , the record-keeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries . We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries ; however , based on our current analyses , we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America.Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to be members of SIPC . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay higher annual assessments to replenish the reserves . During fiscal year 2013 , certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries incurred expenses amounting to 0.25 % of net operating revenues as defined by SIPC , or approximately $ 4.6 million , to SIPC as a special assessment . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor ’ s and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund . For RJ & A , the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC.RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian currency ( “ CDN ” ) per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . 11IndexRJF is under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by the Fed . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC , the Fed , and the FDIC . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel . RJF as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by bank regulators . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory , and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on our and RJ Bank ’ s financial results . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF ’ s and RJ Bank ’ s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital , risk weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank , to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information.In July 2013 , the OCC , the Federal Reserve Board ( “ FRB ” ) and the FDIC released final United States Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establishes a capital conservation buffer , and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The rule becomes effective for us on January 1 , 2015 , subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both RJF and RJ Bank ; however , based on our current analyses , we believe that RJF and RJ Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules . However , the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors , ” within this Form 10-K for more information.Since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance , generally up to $ 250,000 per account ownership type , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . In February 2011 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments . For banks with more than $ 10 billion in assets , the FDIC ’ s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation , which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC ’ s exposure should the bank fail . This new rule will become effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period . RJ Bank is still evaluating the impact of this change on future FDIC insurance premiums.In July 2011 , pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( “ CFPB ” ) began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws . RJ Bank recently exceeded $ 10 billion in total assets for four consecutive quarters and as a result the CFPB has now assumed regulatory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with various consumer regulations . The CFPB has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment , with the majority of those effective in early fiscal year 2014. RJ Bank is still evaluating the impact of this additional regulator.In October 2012 , under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , regulators issued final rules requiring banking organizations with total assets of more than $ 10 billion but less than $ 50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests , report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed and publish a summary of the results . Under the rules , stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios ( baseline , adverse , and severely adverse ) , which the Fed will provide each year . These new rules require RJF to conduct its first stress test by March 31 , 2014 . In addition , RJF will be required to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results in our fiscal year 2015.RJT , our federally chartered trust company , is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT ’ s fiduciary services . 12IndexAs a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors , the structure of our Audit Committee now named Audit and Risk Committee , and ethical standards for our senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions imposing governance standards , including those regarding “ Say-on-Pay ” votes for shareholders , incentive compensation clawbacks , compensation committee independence and disclosure concerning executive compensation , employee and director hedging and chairman and CEO positions . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain an opinion from our independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.13IndexEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTExecutive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.Item 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock or our senior notes which are listed on the NYSE.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers , investors and employees . If we fail to deal with , or appear to fail to deal with , various issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money-laundering , privacy , record keeping , sales and trading practices , failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality , or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly , can result in customer dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and harm to our reputation . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also result in harm to our prospects . 15IndexWe are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including levels of economic output , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including the levels of trading , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . At times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including low levels of economic output , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , relatively high rates of unemployment , and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad . These conditions led to several factors in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While select factors indicate signs of improvement , uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates , a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets , reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability . We could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting , financial advisory and other services , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers ’ and market participants ’ failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . These periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and , our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited . Future downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world and , in turn , could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and liquidity . Concerns about the European Union ’ s ( “ EU ” ) sovereign debt in recent years has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally . Continued uncertainties loom over the outcome the EU ’ s financial support programs and the possibility exists that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future . Any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from further EU sovereign debt matters could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States , non-U.S. governments , and international agencies . The Fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States . Fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . U.S. state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment , and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue or worsen , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues . In addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfolio.RJ Bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in North America . United States and/or Canadian factors which are indicative of market conditions include : interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.16IndexLack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity , or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment , spending , or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business . Our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations are inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets at the parent company , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . The availability of outside financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on a variety of factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease , to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally , and the strength of counterparties specifically.If RJF ’ s credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our relationships with clients . Such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . As such , we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in one of our credit agreements and certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions ( see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for such information as of September 30 , 2013 ) . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed , the FDIC , and the SEC ( via FINRA ) have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent , for the subsidiaries they supervise . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.We are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives , and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.17IndexIn addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing capital requirements which could adversely affect our profitability.Our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealer businesses exposing us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from , and lend securities to , other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged . In the case of aged securities failed to receive , we may , under industry regulations , purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , could result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including , but not limited to , C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities . We incur credit risk through our investments which include MBS , collateralized mortgage obligations , auction rate securities , and other municipal securities.Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to a natural disaster , act of terrorism , severe weather event , or economic event , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . 18IndexDeclines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products and on fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products , such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . Assets under management balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition . If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts , our fee revenue would decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.We have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . 19IndexOur ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Furthermore , although we do not hold any EU sovereign debt , we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the EU sovereign debt circumstances . As a result , defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty , any such losses in the future may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.We have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.Our business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.We may not realize cost savings or other benefits that we anticipated in connection with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan.On April 2 , 2012 we completed our purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan ( refer to the discussion of this acquisition in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K ) . Acquisitions of this magnitude pose numerous risks , including the failure to achieve anticipated synergies or to realize the projected benefits of the transaction ; potential loss of clients or key employees , and the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth . Even though during the year ended September 30 , 2013 we successfully completed the integration of its businesses into those of RJ & A , there is no assurance that the net results of this acquisition over time will yield all of the positive benefits anticipated . If we are not successful in any or all of these areas , there is a risk that our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement dated January 11 , 2012 entered into by RJF and Regions governing our acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( the “ SPA ” ) , Regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . RJF is relying on Regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions , or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding these indemnification agreements.Growth of our business could increase costs and regulatory risks.Integrating acquired businesses , providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial , managerial and operational challenges . We may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses , or recruitment of financial advisors , or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth.20IndexExpansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal control procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . Moreover , to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions , we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms , or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business . Such acquisitions could be of significant size and/or complexity . This effort , together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business , could have an adverse affect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions , which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage . Any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings , or perhaps at all . We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our competitors . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms , hedge funds , and others . This competition could cause our business to suffer.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . In addition , the continued development of internet , networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure . An inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Our ability to attract and retain qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business.Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors . As such , to compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee ’ s decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee ’ s decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . To the extent we have compensation targets , we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are within our target range . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel.Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us.21IndexWe are exposed to operational risk.Our diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems , external events , including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center , operations processing sites or our branches . Our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets . The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards . It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct , and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases . If our employees engage in misconduct , our businesses would be adversely affected . Operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption , system failures or failed transaction processing . Third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk , including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties . In addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services , we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes . Increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations.Our business contingency plan in place is intended to ensure we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets , including staff and technology , in the event of a business interruption . Despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans , due to unforeseen factors , our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access , catastrophic events including weather related events , events involving electrical , environmental or communications malfunctions , as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . Our businesses depend on technology.Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.Our continued success depends , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands , and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients , violations of applicable privacy and other laws , and regulatory sanctions . 22IndexCustomer , public , and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased . Thus , our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures , disruptions and breakdowns . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise , to-date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches , however , there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future . Notwithstanding that we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our , or our clients ’ or counterparties ’ , confidential and other information processed , stored in , and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.Extraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . While we have made investments to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes , there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances . Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause , among other things , unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire , resulting in client dissatisfaction.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing these types of operational risk.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Certain of our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations and we are in process of transitioning our information systems processing to our new information technology data center in the Denver , Colorado area ( see Item 2 , “ Properties ” in this Form 10-K for further discussion ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications , and the ability of our associates to get to our offices , or work from home . Refer to the “ we are exposed to credit risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events , including weather events , could adversely impact RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio and the “ we are exposed to operational risk ” risk factor in this Item 1A , for a discussion of how weather related events could impact our ability to conduct business.We are exposed to litigation risks.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising in the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability for us . Advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances . Such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor . To the extent we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them , we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers , which could harm our business . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . In highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ’ investment objectives , the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . 23IndexIn addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ’ fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.As it pertains to Morgan Keegan , a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition are subject to indemnification from Regions . Refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled , “ Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters ” for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnifications.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available for sale securities including Auction Rate Securities ( “ ARS ” ) , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , in this Form 10-K.24IndexOur risk management and conflicts of interests policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and , as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and/or our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Additionally , a political , economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally.We have risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.25IndexRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTChanges in regulations resulting from either the Dodd-Frank Act or any new regulations may affect our businesses.The market and economic conditions over the past several years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry , including significant additional legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately , while the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy can not be known until all such implementing regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized and implemented.The Dodd-Frank Act may impact the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and operations and interact with regulators , all of which while not currently anticipated to , could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have or may impact our business include , but are not limited to : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers , regulatory oversight of incentive compensation , the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading . There is also increased regulatory scrutiny ( and related compliance costs ) as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act . These include but are not limited to RJ Bank ’ s oversight by the CFPB.Additionally , we are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the “ Volcker Rule. ” Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted , the precise definition of prohibited “ proprietary trading ” , the scope of any exceptions , including those related to market making and hedging activities , and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund investments remain uncertain . It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of our market making and related risk mitigation activities , as currently conducted , will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected . In addition , the rules , if enacted as proposed , could prohibit our participation and investment in certain securitization structures and could bar us from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds . Also , should regulators not exercise their authority to permit us to hold certain investments , including those in illiquid private equity funds , beyond the minimum statutory divestment period , we could incur substantial losses when we dispose of such investments . We may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time . When the regulations are final , we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities and make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule , which will likely not require full conformance until July 2014 , subject to extensions.To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.The SEC recently adopted amendments , most of which were effective October , 2013 , to its financial responsibility rules , including changes to the net capital rule , the customer protection rule , the record-keeping rules , and the notification rules applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries . We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries ; however , based on our current analyses , we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.26IndexThe Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitability.In July 2013 , the OCC , the FRB and the FDIC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act . The rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital , establishes a capital conservation buffer , and makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets . The rule becomes effective for us January 1 , 2015 , subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule , including the new minimum capital ratio requirements , the capital conservation buffer , and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions . We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both RJ Bank and RJF . The increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected.Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to RJF , RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank ’ s assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF ’ s and RJ Bank ’ s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital , risk weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm either RJF or RJ Bank ’ s operations and our financial condition.Additionally , as RJF is a holding company , it depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including , among others , debt service . We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and the net capital rule of FINRA , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canada based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations.See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.We operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including , but not limited to , sales and trading methods , trade practices among broker-dealers , use and safekeeping of customers ’ funds and securities , capital structure of securities firms , anti-money laundering efforts , record keeping and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . If laws or regulations are violated , we could be subject to one or more of the following : civil liability , criminal liability , sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.27IndexWe currently invest in selected private equity and merchant banking investments ( see the description of this activity in the “ Other ” section of Part 1 , Item 1 Business , within this Form 10-K ) . As a financial holding company , the magnitude of such investments is subject to certain limitations . At our current investment levels , we do not anticipate having to make any otherwise unplanned divestitures of these investments in order to comply with regulatory limits ; however , the amount of future investments may be limited in order to maintain compliance within regulatory specified levels . We are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements including the maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses . However , due to our strong current capital position , we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information.As a financial holding company , we are regulated by the Fed . RJ Bank is regulated by the OCC , the Fed , the CFPB , and the FDIC . This oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations . The economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry , including many proposals for new rules . Any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . We also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state , or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , the impact of changes such as those currently proposed can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse affect on our business , financial condition or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be , volatile and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have , from time to time , experienced significant downward pressure in connection with economic conditions or events and may again experience such pressures in the future . Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry , as well as geopolitical , economic and business factors unrelated to us , may also affect our stock price . Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition . Our current shareholders may experience dilution in their holdings if we issue additional shares of common stock as a result of future offerings or acquisitions where we use our common stock.As part of our business strategy , we may seek opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions in which we may consider issuing equity securities as part of the consideration . Additionally , we may obtain additional capital through the public sale of debt or equity securities . If we sell equity securities , the value of our common stock could experience dilution . Furthermore , these securities could have rights , preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the common stock . Moreover , if we issue additional shares of common stock in connection with equity compensation , future acquisitions , or as a result of financing , an investor ’ s ownership interest in our company will be diluted.28IndexThe issuance of any additional shares of common stock , or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock , or the exercise of such securities , could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock . Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and , therefore , such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders . The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales or issuance of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.Item 1B .

Financial advisors affiliated with RJFS may offer their clients all products and services offered through RJ & A including investment advisory products and services which are offered through its affiliated registered investment advisor , RJFSA . Both RJFS and RJFSA clear all of their business on a fully disclosed basis through RJ & A.On April 2 , 2012 ( the “ Closing Date ” ) , RJF completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of MK & Co. and MK Holding , Inc. and certain of its affiliates ( collectively referred to hereinafter as “ Morgan Keegan ” ) from Regions Financial Corporation ( “ Regions ” ) . MK & Co. is a self-clearing broker-dealer , headquartered in Memphis , Tennessee , engaged in most aspects of securities distribution and trading . MK & Co. is a member of the NYSE and most regional exchanges in the U.S. , as well as FINRA and SIPC . Morgan Keegan brings us a strong private client business , one of the industry 's top fixed income and public finance groups , and a significant equity capital markets division.RJ Ltd. is our Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary which engages in both retail and institutional distribution and investment banking . RJ Ltd. is a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange ( “ TSX ” ) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada ( “ IIROC ” ) . Its U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of FINRA and SIPC.Eagle is a registered investment advisor serving as the discretionary manager for individual and institutional equity and fixed income portfolios and our internally sponsored mutual funds . RJ Bank originates and purchases commercial and industrial ( “ C & I ” ) loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , as well as consumer loans , all of which are funded primarily by cash balances swept from the investment accounts of our broker-dealer subsidiaries ' clients . BUSINESS SEGMENTSWe have eight business segments : “ Private Client Group ” or “ PCG ” ; “ Capital Markets ” ; “ Asset Management ” ; RJ Bank ; “ Emerging Markets ” ; “ Securities Lending ” ; “ Proprietary Capital ” and certain corporate activities combined in the “ Other ” segment . Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended September 30 , 2012 , September 30 , 2011 , and September 30 , 2010 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.3IndexPRIVATE CLIENT GROUPWe provide securities transaction and financial planning services to over 2.3 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , MK & Co. , RJ Ltd. and Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS ” ) , in the United Kingdom . Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . In fiscal year 2012 , the portion of revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include sources such as asset-based fees including mutual fund and annuity trailing commissions , and interest income and represented approximately 64 % of the Private Client Group 's total revenues . Revenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration . As of September 30 , 2012 , client assets under administration of our private client group amounted to $ 368 billion.The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJ & A . Through the financial advisors of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries , PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage.Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load funds . RJ & A , MK & Co. and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers.Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances , predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations , less interest paid on customer cash balances ( “ Client Interest Program ” ) . We also utilize a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue . The cash sweep program , the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , is a multi-bank ( RJ Bank and several non-affiliated banks ) program under which clients ' cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third party service into interest-bearing deposit accounts ( $ 245,000 per bank for individual accounts and $ 490,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This program enables clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual FDIC deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) in addition to competitive rates for their cash balances . See Item 7 , “ Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues.Clients ' transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . RJ & A , MK & Co. and RJ Ltd. make margin loans to clients collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client 's account.Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJ & A and MK & Co. 's source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities.No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business.Raymond James & Associates RJ & A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ & A 's financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staffs .

Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of information resources.CAPITAL MARKETSCapital Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and services . During fiscal year 2012 , we integrated MK & Co 's equity capital markets , including research and investment banking , as well as certain fixed income operations , into RJ & A . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . Institutional SalesInstitutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment 's revenue , which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group 's ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities . Our institutional clients are serviced by institutional equity departments of RJ & A and RJ Ltd. ; the RJ & A and MK & Co. fixed income departments ; RJ & A 's European offices ; Raymond James Financial International , Ltd , an institutional UK broker-dealer headquartered in London , England ; and Raymond James European Securities , Inc. , ( “ RJES ” ) a joint venture that is headquartered in Paris , France in which we hold a controlling interest . We charge commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved.Over 100 domestic and overseas professionals located in offices in the U.S. and Europe comprise RJ & A 's institutional equity sales and sales trading departments and maintain relationships with more than 1,200 institutional clients . Some European and U.S. offices also provide services to high net worth clients .

RJ & A enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “ to be announced ” securities ( e.g. , securities having a stated coupon and original term to maturity , although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction ) . Low levels of proprietary trading positions are also periodically taken by RJ & A for various purposes and are closely monitored within well defined limits . In addition , a subsidiary of RJF , RJ Capital Services , Inc. , participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal , either to economically hedge RJ & A fixed income inventory , for transactions with customers , or to a limited extent for its own account.6IndexEquity ResearchThe domestic analysts in RJ & A 's research department support our institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on approximately 1,000 companies .

( “ RJTCF ” ) is the general partner or managing member in a number of limited partnerships and limited liability companies . These partnerships and limited liability companies invest in real estate project entities that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code . RJTCF has been an active participant in the tax credit program since its inception in 1986 and currently focuses on tax credit funds for institutional investors that invest in a portfolio of tax credit-eligible multi-family apartments . The investors ' expected returns on their investments in these funds are primarily derived from tax credits and tax losses that investors can use to reduce their federal tax liability . During fiscal 2012 , RJTCF invested approximately $ 596 million for large institutional investors in approximately 80 real estate transactions for properties located throughout the U.S . Since inception , RJTCF has raised over $ 4 billion in equity and has sponsored 75 tax credit funds , with investments in over 1,400 tax credit apartment properties in nearly all 50 states and one U.S. Territory.7IndexASSET MANAGEMENTOur Asset Management segment includes the operations of Eagle , the Eagle Family of Funds ( “ Eagle Funds ” ) , the asset management operations of RJ & A ( “ AMS ” ) , Raymond James Trust , and other fee-based programs . The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios , mutual funds and managed programs . Investment advisory fees are also earned on assets held in managed and non-managed programs . These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter , the end of the quarter , or average assets . Consistent with industry practice , fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period . Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds . Rising markets positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value , and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business.Eagle Asset Management , Inc.Eagle is a registered investment advisor with approximately $ 20 billion in assets under management and $ 1.6 billion in assets under advisement ( non-discretionary advised assets ) as of September 30 , 2012 . Eagle offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and a subsidiary investment advisor , Eagle Boston Investment Management , Inc. Eagle 's clients include institutions , corporations , pension and profit sharing plans , foundations , endowments , variable annuities , individuals and mutual funds . Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Funds . Most clients are charged fees based upon assets under management , however in some cases performance fees may be earned for outperforming respective benchmarks . Eagle also earns fees on non-discretionary assets for providing their account models to professional advisors at other firms.Eagle Fund Distributors , Inc. ( “ EFD ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle , is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Funds.The Small Cap Growth Fund , Mid Cap Growth Fund , Growth and Income Fund , Mid Cap Stock Fund , Investment Grade Bond Fund , and Eagle Smaller Company Fund are managed by Eagle . The Capital Appreciation Fund and International Equity Fund utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors.Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through an unrelated third party.AMSAMS manages several investment advisory programs which maintain an approved list of investment managers , provide asset allocation model portfolios , establish custodial facilities , monitor performance of client accounts , provide clients with accounting and other administrative services , and assist investment managers with certain trading management activities . One of AMS ' programs , “ Raymond James Consulting Services ” is a managed program in which Raymond James Consulting Services serves as a conduit for AMS clients to access a number of independent investment managers , in addition to Eagle , with initial investment amounts that are far below normal program minimums , as well as providing monitoring and due diligence services . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.35 % to 0.85 % of asset balances per annum , a portion of which is paid to predominately independent investment managers and Eagle who direct the investments within clients ' accounts . In addition , AMS offers additional accounts managed within fee based asset allocation platforms under our Freedom accounts and other managed programs . Freedom 's investment committee manages portfolios of mutual funds , exchange traded funds and separately managed account models on a discretionary basis . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.10 % to 0.50 % of these asset balances per annum . For separately managed account models a portion of the fee may be paid to the investment managers who provide the models . At September 30 , 2012 , these managed programs had over $ 24 billion in assets under management , including approximately $ 4 billion managed by Eagle.8IndexAMS also provides certain services for their non-managed fee-based programs ( Passport , Ambassador and other non-managed programs ) . They provide performance reporting , research , sales , accounting , trading and other administrative services . Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors . Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts . Total client fees generally range from 0.50 % to 3.00 % of assets , and are predominantly allocated to the PCG segment , with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities allocated to this Asset Management segment . As of September 30 , 2012 , these programs had approximately $ 51 billion in assets . RJFS and RJFSA offer similar fee-based programs called IMPAC ( “ IMPAC ” ) . All revenues for IMPAC are allocated to either RJFS or RJFSA . As of September 30 , 2012 , IMPAC had approximately $ 11.6 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors and RJFSA registered investment advisors ( see the Private Client Group segment discussion in this Item 1 for additional information ) . Morgan Keegan offers similar programs to its clients as those described above , which will be incorporated into the above described AMS programs upon the completion of the integration of MK & Co. into RJ & A which is planned for fiscal year 2013.In addition to the foregoing programs , AMS also administers managed fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James Consulting Services program.Raymond James Trust , National AssociationRaymond James Trust , National Association , ( “ RJT ” ) provides personal trust services primarily to existing clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Portfolio management of trust assets can be subcontracted to our asset management operations . This subsidiary had a total of approximately $ 2.5 billion in client assets at September 30 , 2012 , including more than $ 160 million in the donor-advised charitable foundation known as the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund.RJ BANKRJ Bank provides corporate , residential and consumer loans , as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts , to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations . RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . See Item 7 , “ Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank 's net interest earnings . Effective , February 1 , 2012 , RJ Bank became a national bank , regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) , RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to RJF 's headquarters complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank 's products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through telephonic and electronic banking services . RJ Bank 's assets include C & I loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , as well as consumer loans , primarily consisting of securities-based loans . Corporate loans represent approximately 75 % of RJ Bank 's loan portfolio of which 95 % are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans . Residential mortgage loans are originated and held for investment or sold in the secondary market . RJ Bank 's total liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts maintained at RJ & A . RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer ( see table of industry concentration in Item 7A , “ Credit Risk ” ) .EMERGING MARKETSRaymond James International Holdings , Inc. ( “ RJIH ” ) , through its subsidiaries , currently has interests in operations in Latin American countries including Argentina , Uruguay and Brazil . Through these entities we operate securities brokerage , investment banking , asset management and equity research businesses . In fiscal year 2012 , approximately 66 % of this segment 's investment banking revenues arose from one client . No single client accounts for a material percentage of the remainder of revenue generated by this segment.9IndexSECURITIES LENDINGThis segment conducts its business through the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties . Generally , we conduct these activities as an intermediary ( referred to as “ Matched Book ” ) . However , Securities Lending will also loan customer marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit ( referred to as lending from the “ Box ” ) to counterparties . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest . These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in the current market value of the underlying securities . Additionally , securities are borrowed from other broker-dealers ( referred to as borrowing for the “ Box ” ) to facilitate RJ & A 's clearance and settlement obligations . The net revenues of this securities lending business are the interest spreads generated . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business.PROPRIETARY CAPITALThis segment consists of our principal capital and private equity activities including various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments ; employee investment funds ( the “ Employee Funds ” ) ; and various private equity funds which we sponsor including Raymond James Capital Partners , L.P. As of September 30 , 2012 , certain of our merchant banking investments include investments in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company , a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies , an event photography business , and a company pursuing a new concept in the salon services market.We participate in profits or losses through both general and limited partnership interests . Additionally , we realize profits or incur losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments . The Employee Funds are limited partnerships , some of which we are the general partner , that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships . The Employee Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees.OTHERThis segment includes various corporate overhead costs of RJF including the interest cost on our public debt , the acquisition and integration costs associated with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( see further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K ) , and the loss associated with the securities repurchased in the prior year as a result of the auction rate securities ( “ ARS ” ) settlement ( see further discussion of this matter in the Other segment section of Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K ) .COMPETITIONWe are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets.In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel.REGULATIONThe following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries.To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.10IndexThe financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . During our fiscal 2010 , the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . Because of the nature of our business and our business practices , we presently do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole . However , because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies by various regulatory agencies , the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A , RJFS and MK & Co. are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America.Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( “ SROs ” ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers.The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer.Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay higher annual assessments to replenish the reserves . During fiscal year 2012 , certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries incurred expenses amounting to 0.25 % of net operating revenues as defined by SIPC , or approximately $ 4.5 million , to SIPC as a special assessment . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd 's , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor 's and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd 's trust funds and Lloyd 's Central Fund . For RJ & A , the additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC . For MK & Co. , the additional protection currently provided has a limit of $ 124.5 million per customer and an aggregate firm limit of $ 400 million , with no sub-limit for cash above basic SIPC . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations.RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC.RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( “ CIPF ” ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian dollars ( “ CDN ” ) per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements.Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . 11IndexDuring January 2012 , RJF 's application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the Fed and RJ Bank 's conversion was approved by the OCC . These changes became effective February 1 , 2012 . RJF converted to a bank holding company in order to provide RJ Bank the ability to maintain a portfolio with a greater percentage of its assets invested in corporate loans than were otherwise permissible under the thrift regulations RJ Bank was previously subject to . Prior to February 1 , 2012 , RJF was a “ unitary savings and loan holding company ” as defined by federal law , because it owned one savings association , RJ Bank . For the periods through and including September 30 , 2011 , we were under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by , either the Office of Thrift Supervision ( “ OTS ” ) or the OCC ( upon the July 21 , 2011 merger of the OTS with the OCC ) . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the Fed and the FDIC . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel . Since we were a savings and loan holding company prior to May 4 , 1999 , we were exempt from certain restrictions that would otherwise apply under federal law to the activities and investments of a savings and loan holding company . These restrictions would have become applicable to us if RJ Bank had failed to meet an annual qualified thrift lender ( “ QTL ” ) test established by federal law , which required RJ Bank to make qualifying investments to meet this point-in-time test . On September 30 , 2011 , RJ Bank was granted an exception to the QTL requirement until September 29 , 2012 . As RJ Bank converted to a national bank during fiscal 2012 , as of September 30 , 2012 it is no longer subject to the QTL test and no longer has to make qualifying investments in order to maintain regulatory compliance.RJF , as a result of our conversion to a financial holding company , and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by bank regulators . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory , and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on our and RJ Bank 's financial results . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF 's and RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital , risk weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF , as a financial holding company , and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information.In June of 2012 , the OCC , the FRB and the FDIC published three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking ( the “ NPRs ” ) to implement aspects of Basel III , as well as to implement aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act . The proposed rules would increase the quantity and quality of capital required by establishing a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement , a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement , and more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital . In addition , these NPRs propose to apply limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if a specified amount of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet minimum capital requirements is not held and revised rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years . Based on our current internal capital analyses , we believe that RJF and RJ Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the applicable NPRs.However , since these NPRs are subject to change , the adoption of these proposed rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital and liquidity . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected . See Item 1A , “ Risk Factors ” , within this Form 10-K for more information.In addition , since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . Our federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT 's fiduciary services . 12IndexAs a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors , the structure of our Audit Committee , and ethical standards for our senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions imposing governance standards , including those regarding “ Say-on-Pay ” votes for shareholders , incentive compensation clawbacks , compensation committee independence and disclosure concerning executive compensation , employee and director hedging and chairman and CEO positions . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain an opinion from our independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.13IndexEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTExecutive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock or our senior notes which are listed on the NYSE.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers , investors and employees . If we fail to deal with , or appear to fail to deal with , various issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could significantly harm our business prospects . These issues include , but are not limited to , any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A , appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money-laundering , privacy , record keeping , sales and trading practices , failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality , or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly , can result in customer dissatisfaction , litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny , all of which can lead to lost revenue , higher operating costs and harm to our reputation . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also result in harm to our prospects . 15IndexWe are affected by difficult domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions , including levels of economic output , interest and inflation rates , employment levels , consumer confidence levels , and fiscal and monetary policy . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results , including the levels of trading , investing , and origination activity in the securities markets , security valuations , the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates , real estate values , the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers , and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits . During the last five years we have experienced operating cycles during generally weak and uncertain U.S. and global economic conditions , including lower levels of economic output , artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates , high rates of unemployment , and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad . These conditions have led to several factors in the global financial markets that have negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability . While select factors indicate signs of improvement , significant uncertainty remains . A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets , further reductions to the general level of short term interest rates , a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets , further reductions in the value of real estate , and other negative market factors may significantly impair our revenues and profitability . We may experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients , a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting , financial advisory and other services , increased credit provisions and charge-offs , losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations , reduced net interest earnings , and other losses . These periods of reduced revenue and other losses may be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt , rent , facilities and salary expenses are fixed and , our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited . In August 2011 , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's ( “ S & P ” ) lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from AAA to AA+ , while maintaining a negative outlook . The downgrade reflected S & P 's view that an August 2011 agreement of U.S. lawmakers regarding the debt ceiling fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government 's medium term debt dynamics . The two other major credit rating agencies did not downgrade their previously issued U.S. sovereign credit ratings . We have specific concerns relating to future or further downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies that could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world and , in turn , could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and liquidity . Because of the unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations , the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business , financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent.Additionally , the negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from further European Union 's ( “ EU ” ) sovereign debt matters could adversely affect our business , financial condition and liquidity . Concerns about the EU sovereign debt have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally , and continued uncertainties loom over the outcome the EU 's financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the U.S. , non-U.S. governments , and international agencies . The Fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in Fed policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . U.S. state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the recent recession , and concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality . If these trends continue , investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues . Declines in the real estate market over the past few years , along with high foreclosure rates and prolonged high unemployment rates , resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as commercial and investment banks . These write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities , in turn caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases , to fail . 16IndexRJ Bank is particularly affected by domestic economic conditions . Such conditions include : U.S. interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings.Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.Maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity , or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment , spending , or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business . Our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . If liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations are inadequate or unavailable , we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings , changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company , limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings within our subsidiaries , diminished access to the capital markets at the parent company , and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements , judgments , or regulatory sanctions . The availability of outside financing , including access to the credit and capital markets , depends on a variety of factors , such as conditions in the debt and equity markets , the general availability of credit , the volume of securities trading activity , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector , and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . Additionally , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease , to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally , and the strength of counterparties specifically.If RJF 's credit ratings were downgraded , or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur , our business , financial position , and results of operations could be adversely affected , perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged , and as a result , adversely affect our relationships with clients . Such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets , trigger obligations under certain financial agreements , or decrease the number of investors , clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us , thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability . As such , we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . The impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments , and may result in a request for immediate payment and/or ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions . Furthermore , as a bank holding company , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock . The OCC , the Fed and the FDIC have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the entities they supervise . See Item 7 , “ Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.17IndexWe are exposed to market risk.We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread , the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding , which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities . In our brokerage operations , a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread . Conversely in those operations , a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread . If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk , changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.In addition , disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of security positions , thereby leading to increased concentrations . The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions , but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet , thereby increasing capital requirements which could adversely affect our profitability.Our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.We are exposed to credit risk.We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealer businesses exposing us to credit risk . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold certain securities and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses . We borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments.We manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily . A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry , thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure . We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged . In the case of aged securities failed to receive , we may , under industry regulations , purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchaser 's indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans , we may incur losses on those margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . 18IndexWe deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , could result in significant reputational damage , and adversely impact our financial performance.We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including , but not limited to , C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities . We incur credit risk through our investments which include mortgage backed securities , collateralized mortgage obligations , auction rate securities , and other municipal securities.The credit quality of RJ Bank 's loans and our investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings and overall financial performance . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure , for example due to a natural disaster , act of terrorism , severe weather event , or economic event , could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital . Further declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to further write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank 's portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products and on fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries.A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . Assets under management balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition . If we experience losses of managed accounts , our fee revenue will decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues.Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk.We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold.From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.19IndexWe have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash.The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . Furthermore , although we do not hold any EU sovereign debt , we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the recent EU sovereign debt crisis . As a result , defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty , any such losses in the future may materially adversely affect our results of operations.We have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability.In recent years , our business has experienced increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins.20IndexThe acquisition of Morgan Keegan involves risks that could affect our business.On April 2 , 2012 we completed our purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan ( refer to the discussion of this acquisition in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K ) . Acquisitions of this magnitude pose numerous risks , including : difficulty in integrating our and Morgan Keegan 's businesses , services and products ; failure to achieve anticipated synergies or realize the projected benefits of the transaction ; diversion of management 's attention from other business concerns due to transaction-related issues ; potential loss of clients or key employees ; the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients , trading counterparties and business partners ; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth ; and changes in the capital markets . There is no assurance that this acquisition will yield all of the positive benefits anticipated . If we are not able to integrate successfully , there is a risk that our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters.Under the definitive stock purchase agreement dated January 11 , 2012 entered into by RJF and Regions governing our acquisition of Morgan Keegan ( the “ SPA ” ) , Regions has ongoing obligations to indemnify RJF with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters . RJF is relying on Regions fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the SPA with respect to such matters . Our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions , or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified , could result in our incurring significant costs for defense , settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations , financial condition , and our regulatory capital levels.See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding these indemnification agreements.Growth of our business could increase costs and regulatory risks.We may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses , or recruitment of financial advisors , or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth.Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal controls procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . Moreover , to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions , we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms , or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business . Such acquisitions could be of significant size and/or complexity . This effort , together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business , could have an adverse affect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . In addition , we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions , which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage . Any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings , or perhaps at all . We face intense competition.We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services , pricing ( such as execution pricing and fee levels ) , location and reputation in relevant markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our competitors . Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors . As such , to compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity.21IndexWe compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . Domestic commercial banks and investment banking boutique firms have entered the broker-dealer business , and large international banks are now serving our markets as well . Legislative and regulatory initiatives which eased what were at one time restrictions on the sales of securities and underwriting activities by commercial banks have increased competition . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms , hedge funds , and others . This increased competition could cause our business to suffer.Competition for personnel within the financial services industry is intense . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee 's decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee 's decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense , we may have to devote significantly more resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors . Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us.To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . In addition , the continued development of internet , networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure . An inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.We are exposed to operational risk.Our diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events . Our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets . The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards , business disruption or system failures and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . While we have business contingency plans in place , our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access , catastrophic events including weather related events , events involving electrical , environmental or communications , as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . Our businesses depend on technology.Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards.22IndexOur continued success will depend , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to our reputation . Customer , public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased . Thus , our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures , disruptions and breakdowns . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although to-date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches , there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future . Notwithstanding that we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service ( “ DDOS ” ) attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our , or our clients ' or counterparties ' , confidential and other information processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our , our clients ' , our counterparties ' or third parties ' operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements , exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.Extraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . While we have made investments to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and added hardware to address extraordinary volumes , there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances . Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause , among other things , unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients , slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire , decreased levels for client service and client satisfactions and harm to our reputation . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing these types of operational risk.Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions.Our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan and Memphis , Tennessee locations ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this Form 10-K ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications and the ability of our associates to get to our offices or work from home . Refer to the `` we are exposed to credit risk '' risk factor in this Item 1A for a discussion of how events , including weather events , could adversely impact RJ Bank 's loan portfolio and the `` we are exposed to operational risk '' risk factor in this Item 1A , for a discussion of how weather related events could impact our ability to conduct business.We are exposed to litigation risks.Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising from the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability for us . Advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances . Such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor . To the extent we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them , we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers , which could harm our business . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . 23IndexIn highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ' investment objectives ( including auction rate securities ) , the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . In addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability , the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time . The amount of outside attorneys ' fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations.As it pertains to Morgan Keegan , a number of the types of claims and matters described above are subject to indemnification from Regions . Refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled , “ Regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with Morgan Keegan matters ” for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnifications.See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results.The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank 's allowance for loan losses . At any given point in time , conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank 's loan portfolio . If management 's underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management 's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates , ” in this Form 10-K for additional information on the nature of these estimates.Our financial instruments , including certain trading assets and liabilities , available for sale securities including ARS , certain loans , intangible assets and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Estimates ” discussion within Item 7 , and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , in this Form 10-K.24IndexOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K.We are exposed to risk from international markets.We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and , as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and/or our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Additionally , a political , economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally.We have risks related to our insurance programs.Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ' compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business.25IndexRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTChanges in regulations resulting from either the Dodd-Frank act or any new regulations may affect our businesses.The market and economic conditions over the past few years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry , including significant additional legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately , while the details of many provisions are subject to additional studies and final rule writing by various applicable regulatory agencies . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy can not be known until all such rules and regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized and implemented.The Dodd-Frank Act may impact the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and its operations and interact with regulators , all of which while not currently anticipated to , could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business include , but are not limited to : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers , regulatory oversight of incentive compensation , the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading . Additionally , we are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the “ Volcker Rule. ” Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted , the precise definition of prohibited “ proprietary trading ” , the scope of any exceptions for market making and hedging , and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund activities remains uncertain . It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of our market-making and risk mitigation activities , as currently conducted , will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected . In addition , the rules , if enacted as proposed , would prohibit certain securitization structures and would bar U.S. banking entities from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds . Also , with respect to certain of our investments in illiquid private equity funds , should regulators not exercise their authority to permit us to hold such investments beyond the minimum statutory divestment period , we could incur substantial losses when we dispose of such investments , as we may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time . When the regulations are final , we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities to make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule , which will likely not require full conformance until July 2014 , subject to extensions.To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital , liquidity and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitability.In June of 2012 , the OCC , the FRB and the FDIC published three NPRs to implement aspects of Basel III , as well as to implement aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act . The proposed rules would increase the quantity and quality of capital required by establishing a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement , a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement , and more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital . In addition , these NPRs propose to apply limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet minimum capital requirements is not held and revised rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years . Given that these proposed NPRs are subject to change , the adoption of these proposed rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital and liquidity . As a result , our business , results of operations , financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected.26IndexWe operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition.The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including , but not limited to , sales and trading methods , trade practices among broker-dealers , use and safekeeping of customers ' funds and securities , capital structure of securities firms , anti-money laundering efforts , record keeping and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . If laws or regulations are violated , we could be subject to one or more of the following : civil liability , criminal liability , sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ' registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.During fiscal year 2012 , RJF became both a bank holding company and a financial holding company . Although we have a statutory grace period of two years , with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of up to five years , to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies , we expect to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which we currently engage . After such time , it is possible that certain of our existing activities will be deemed to be impermissible under applicable regulations . In addition , as a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Fed , we are now subject to the Fed 's risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements . We currently invest in selected private equity and merchant banking investments ( see the description of this activity in the “ Proprietary Capital ” section of Part 1 , Item 1 Business , within this Form 10-K ) . As a financial holding company , the magnitude of such investments is subject to certain limitations . At our current investment levels , we do not anticipate having to make any otherwise unplanned divestitures of these investments in order to comply with regulatory limits , however , the amount of future investments may be limited in order to maintain compliance within regulatory specified levels . As a result of our conversion , we are subject to additional bank holding company regulatory reporting requirements which add to our administrative workload and costs . The maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses . However , due to our strong current capital position , we do not anticipate that these capital requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information.As a financial holding company , we are regulated by the Fed . RJ Bank is also regulated by the OCC and FDIC . This oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations . The economic and political environment has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry , including many proposals for new rules . Any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . We also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state , or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . Any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , the impact of changes such as those currently proposed can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . See the section entitled “ Business - Regulation ” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this Form 10-K regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse affect on our business , financial condition or results of operation.27IndexFailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements would significantly harm our business.We are subject to the SEC 's uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and the net capital rule of FINRA , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canada based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction.RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJF and RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJF 's and RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital , risk weightings of assets , off-balance sheet transactions , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJF and RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm RJ Bank 's operations and our financial condition.Additionally , as RJF is a holding company , it depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including , among others , debt service . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations . See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulations and capital requirements.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be , volatile and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have , from time to time , experienced significant downward pressure in connection with economic conditions or events and may again experience such pressures in the future . Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry , as well as geopolitical , economic and business factors unrelated to us , may also affect our stock price . Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition . Our current shareholders may experience dilution in their holdings if we issue additional shares of common stock as a result of future offerings or acquisitions where we use our common stock.As part of our business strategy , we may seek opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions in which we may consider issuing equity securities as part of the consideration . Additionally , we may obtain additional capital through the public sale of debt or equity securities . If we sell equity securities , the value of our common stock could experience dilution . Furthermore , these securities could have rights , preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the common stock . Moreover , if we issue additional shares of common stock in connection with equity compensation , future acquisitions , or as a result of financing , an investor 's ownership interest in our company will be diluted.The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock , or the exercise of such securities , could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock . Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and , therefore , such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders . The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales or issuance of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.28IndexOur officers , directors and employees own a substantial amount of our common stock and therefore exercise significant control over our corporate governance and affairs , which may result in their taking actions with which other shareholders do not agree.As of September 30 , 2012 , our executive officers , directors and employees control a relatively significant portion of our outstanding common stock ( including restricted stock and exercisable stock options which they hold ) . These shareholders , if they act together , may be able to exercise substantial influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders , including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions , which may result in corporate action with which other shareholders do not agree . This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that might affect the market price of our common stock , given that our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote to approve any of the specified types of business combinations.ITEM 1B .

BUSINESS SEGMENTS We have eight business segments : “ Private Client Group ” or “ PCG ” ; “ Capital Markets ” ; “ Asset Management ” ; RJ Bank ; “ Emerging Markets ” ; “ Securities Lending ” ( formerly named “ Stock Loan/Borrow ” ) ; “ Proprietary Capital ” and certain corporate activities combined in the “ Other ” segment . Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended September 30 , 2011 , September 30 , 2010 , and September 30 , 2009 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto . PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP We provide securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately two million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS '' ) , a joint venture in the United Kingdom . Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third-party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . In fiscal year 2011 , the portion of revenues from this segment that we consider recurring include sources such as asset-based fees including mutual fund and annuity trailing commissions , and interest income and represented approximately 61 % of the Private Client Group 's total revenues . Revenues of this segment are correlated with total client assets under administration . As of September 30 , 2011 , total client assets under administration amounted to $ 256 billion . 2 The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJ & A . Through the financial advisors of our broker-dealer subsidiaries , PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage . Our financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load funds .

Beginning in September 2009 , we began a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue in lieu of interest revenue . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues . Clients ' transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . RJ & A makes margin loans to clients collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client 's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJ & A 's source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . Raymond James & Associates RJ & A is a full service broker-dealer that employs financial advisors throughout the U.S. RJ & A 's financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staffs .

Since inception , RJTCF has raised over $ 3.5 billion in equity and has sponsored over 70 tax credit funds , with investments in over 1,350 tax credit apartment properties in 45 states and one U.S . Territory . ASSET MANAGEMENT Our Asset Management segment includes the operations of Eagle , the Eagle Family of Funds ( “ Eagle Funds ” ) , the asset management operations of RJ & A ( “ AMS ” ) , Raymond James Trust , and other fee-based programs . The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios and mutual funds . Investment advisory fees are also earned on assets held in managed and non-managed programs . These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter , the end of the quarter , or average assets . Consistent with industry practice , fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period . Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds . Increasing markets generally positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value , and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . Eagle Asset Management , Inc. Eagle is a registered investment advisor with $ 16.1 billion under management and $ 800 million in assets under advisement ( non-discretionary advised assets ) as of September 30 , 2011 . Eagle offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and a subsidiary investment advisor , Eagle Boston Investment Management , Inc. Eagle 's clients include individuals , corporations , pension and profit sharing plans , foundations , endowments , variable annuities and mutual funds . Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Funds . Additionally , performance fees may be earned for performing above respective benchmarks . Eagle also earns fees on non-discretionary assets for providing their account models to professional advisors at other firms . Eagle Fund Distributors , Inc. ( “ EFD ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle , is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Funds . The Eagle Funds utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors for the Capital Appreciation Fund and International Equity Fund . The Small Cap Growth Fund , Mid Cap Growth Fund , Growth and Income Fund , Large Cap Core Fund , Mid Cap Stock Fund , Investment Grade Bond Fund , and Small Cap Core Value Fund are managed by Eagle . Eagle closed its money market funds during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 . Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through an unrelated third-party . AMS AMS manages several investment advisory programs which maintain an approved list of investment managers , provide asset allocation model portfolios , establish custodial facilities , monitor performance of client accounts , provide clients with accounting and other administrative services , and assist investment managers with certain trading management activities . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.35 % to 0.85 % of asset balances per annum , a portion of which is paid to predominately independent investment managers and Eagle who direct the investments within clients ' accounts . In addition , AMS offers additional managed accounts managed within fee based asset allocation platforms under our Freedom accounts and other managed programs . Freedom ’ s investment committee manages portfolios of mutual funds , exchange traded funds and separately managed account models on a discretionary basis . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.10 % to 0.55 % of asset balances per annum . For separately managed account models a portion of the fee may be paid to the investment managers who provide the separately managed account models . At September 30 , 2011 , these managed programs had $ 19.6 billion in assets under management , including $ 3.6 billion managed by Eagle . 7 AMS also provides certain services for their non-managed fee-based programs ( Passport , Ambassador and other non-managed programs ) . They provide performance reporting , research , sales , accounting , trading and other administrative services . Advisory services are provided by PCG financial advisors . Client fees are based on the individual account or relationship size and may also be dependent on the type of securities in the accounts . Total client fees generally range from 0.50 % to 3.00 % of assets , and are predominantly allocated to the PCG segment , with a lesser share of revenue generated from these activities allocated to this Asset Management segment . As of September 30 , 2011 , these programs had $ 38.9 billion in assets . RJFS and RJFSA offer similar fee-based programs called IMPAC ( “ IMPAC ” ) . All revenues for IMPAC are allocated to either RJFS or RJFSA . As of September 30 , 2011 , IMPAC had nearly $ 10 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors and RJFSA registered investment advisors ( see the Private Client Group segment discussion for additional information ) . In addition to the foregoing programs , AMS also administers managed fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James consulting services program . Raymond James Trust , National Association Raymond James Trust , National Association , ( “ RJT ” ) provides personal trust services primarily to existing clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries . Portfolio management of trust assets can be subcontracted to our asset management operations . This subsidiary had a total of approximately $ 2 billion in client assets at September 30 , 2011 , including nearly $ 120 million in the donor-advised charitable foundation known as the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund . RJ BANK RJ Bank is a federally chartered savings bank , regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) , which provides corporate , residential and consumer loans , as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts , to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and bank participations as well as purchases residential whole loan packages to hold for investment . RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank ’ s net interest earnings . RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to our headquarters complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank 's products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through telephonic and electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include C & I loans , commercial and residential real estate loans , as well as consumer loans that were purchased or originated by RJ Bank . Corporate loans represent approximately 75 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio of which 90 % are Shared National Credits ( “ SNC ” ) or other large syndicated loans . SNCs are loan syndications totaling over $ 20 million that are shared among three or more regulated institutions . Purchased loans originated by select large financial institutions represent approximately 85 % of RJ Bank ’ s residential mortgage loan portfolio . RJ Bank ’ s total liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts maintained at RJ & A . This cash sweep program , the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , is a multi-bank ( RJ Bank and other non-affiliated banks ) program under which clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third-party service into interest-bearing deposit accounts ( $ 245,000 per bank for individual accounts and $ 490,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This program enables clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual FDIC deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) in addition to competitive rates for their cash balances . RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer ( see table of industry concentration in Item 7A , “ Market Risk ” ) . 8 EMERGING MARKETS Raymond James International Holdings , Inc. ( “ RJIH ” ) , through its subsidiaries , currently has interests in operations in Latin American countries including Argentina , Uruguay and Brazil . Through these entities we operate securities brokerage , investment banking , asset management and equity research businesses . In fiscal year 2011 , approximately 75 % of this segments ’ investment banking revenues arose from one client . No single client accounts for a material percentage of the remainder of the revenue generated by this segment . SECURITIES LENDING This segment conducts its business through the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties . Generally , we conduct these activities as an intermediary ( referred to as “ Matched Book ” ) . However , Securities Lending will also loan customer marginable securities held in a margin account containing a debit ( referred to as lending from the “ Box ” ) to counterparties . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest . These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in the current market value of the underlying securities . Additionally , securities are borrowed from other broker-dealers ( referred to as borrowing for the “ Box ” ) to facilitate RJ & A ’ s clearance and settlement obligations . The net revenues of this securities lending business are the interest spreads generated . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment ’ s total business . PROPRIETARY CAPITAL This segment consists of our principal capital and private equity activities including various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments ; Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II ( the “ EIF Funds ” ) ; and a private equity fund which we sponsor – Raymond James Capital Partners , L.P. As of September 30 , 2011 , certain of our merchant banking investments include an investment in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies , an event photography business , and an indirect investment in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company . We participate in profits or losses through both general and limited partnership interests . Additionally , we incur profits or losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments . The EIF Funds are limited partnerships , for which we are the general partner , that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships . The EIF Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees . OTHER This segment includes various corporate overhead costs , including interest expense on our senior debt and the loss associated with the securities repurchased as a result of settlements with the SEC and other regulatory authorities regarding the offer and sale of auction rate securities ( “ ARS ” ) . ( See further discussion of the ARS matter in Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” ) . COMPETITION We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . 9 REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business . The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . During our fiscal 2010 , the U. S. government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . Because of the nature of our business and our business practices , we presently do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole . However , because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies by various regulatory agencies , the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain . Effective July 21 , 2011 , and in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act , RJF , as the holding company of RJ Bank , became subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ FRB ” ) . As a result , RJF is subject to periodic examination by the FRB . In addition , the Office of Thrift Supervision ( “ OTS ” ) merged into the OCC and , therefore , the OCC assumed responsibility from the OTS for the ongoing examination , supervision , and regulation of federal savings associations and rulemaking for all savings associations , state and federal . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay higher annual assessments to replenish the reserves . During fiscal year 2011 , certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries incurred expenses amounting to 0.25 % of net operating revenues as defined by SIPC , or approximately $ 3.2 million , to SIPC as a special assessment . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor ’ s and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund . The additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC . 10 RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $ 1 million Canadian dollars ( “ CDN ” ) per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . We are a “ unitary savings and loan holding company ” as defined by federal law , because we own one savings association , RJ Bank . For the periods through and including September 30 , 2011 , we were under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by , either the OTS or the OCC ( upon the July 21 , 2011 merger of the OTS with the OCC ) . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FRB and the FDIC . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel . Since we were a savings and loan holding company prior to May 4 , 1999 , we are exempt from certain restrictions that would otherwise apply under federal law to the activities and investments of a savings and loan holding company . These restrictions would become applicable to us if RJ Bank had failed to meet a qualified thrift lender ( “ QTL ” ) test established by federal law . On September 30 , 2011 , RJ Bank was granted an exception to the QTL requirement until September 29 , 2012 . As of September 30 , 2010 , RJ Bank was in compliance with QTL standards according to the Domestic Building and Loan Association ( “ DBLA ” ) test . This test required RJ Bank to meet a “ business operations test ” and a point-in-time “ 60 % of assets test ” on the last day of each fiscal year . The business operations test required the business to consist primarily of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans . The 60 % of assets test required that at least 60 % of the assets consist of qualifying assets that thrifts normally hold pursuant to regulations . As of September 30 , 2010 , RJ Bank met the business operations test and the 60 % of assets test with 62 % of qualifying assets . In order to meet this point-in-time percentage of assets requirement , RJ Bank held an additional $ 3.5 billion in qualifying assets , which was funded by a $ 2.4 billion overnight Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( “ FHLB ” ) advance , deposits of approximately $ 400 million from affiliates , and additional deposits of approximately $ 700 million from the RJBDP . The deposits from affiliates were withdrawn and the FHLB advance was repaid on October 1 , 2010 . The RJBDP deposits were redirected to other RJBDP participating banks during early October 2010 . The consequences for financial institutions which fail the QTL test include the requirement to either become a national bank or be prohibited from making or engaging in any non-allowable investments or activities , the establishment of new branch offices and the repayment of dividends . RJ Bank applied to the OCC in November , 2008 to convert to a national bank . RJ Bank ’ s application to convert to a national bank is still pending and approval is anticipated before the end of the calendar year . This charter conversion also requires , by law , that RJF become a bank holding company . Accordingly , in December , 2008 , RJF applied to the FRB to become a bank holding company . RJF re-filed its application to become a bank holding company at the request of the FRB in November , 2011 . We anticipate approval before the end of the calendar year . Upon conversion from a thrift to a national bank charter , RJ Bank would no longer be subject to the QTL requirement . RJF will then become a bank holding company and can elect to become a financial holding company . RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by bank regulators . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJ Bank 's financial statements and consequently ours . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information . 11 In addition , since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . Our federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT ’ s fiduciary services . As a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors , the structure of our Audit Committee , and ethical standards for our senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions imposing governance standards , including those regarding “ Say-on-Pay ” votes for shareholders , incentive compensation clawbacks , compensation committee independence and disclosure concerning executive compensation , employee and director hedging and chairman and CEO positions . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain an opinion from our independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting . 12 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Executive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , liquidity and the trading price of our common stock . 14 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY We are affected by difficult conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions generally . We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by economic and political conditions . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to our operating results , including the inflation rate , the related impact on the securities markets including changes in volume , interest spreads and price levels of securities , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , reduced investor confidence , and a slowdown in economic activity . These conditions historically have impacted our trading volume and net revenues and affected our profitability . Additionally , a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand . Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in the value of securities we hold in inventory as assets , and potentially reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which we participate . In addition , declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios , and may result in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations , as well as the failure of our clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans , we may lose money on these margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . On August 5 , 2011 , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s ( “ S & P ” ) lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from AAA to AA+ , while maintaining a negative outlook . While U.S. lawmakers reached agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling on August 2 , 2011 , the downgrade reflected S & P ’ s view that the fiscal consolidation plan within that agreement fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government ’ s medium term debt dynamics . The two other major credit rating agencies did not downgrade their previously issued U.S. sovereign credit ratings . Future downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world and , in turn , could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and liquidity . Because of the unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations , the ultimate impacts on global markets and our business , financial condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent . Continued declines in the real estate market over the past few years , with increasing foreclosures and unemployment , have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as commercial and investment banks . These write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities , have in turn caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases , to fail . RJ Bank is particularly affected by domestic economic conditions . Such conditions include : U.S. interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect corporate loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the U.S. , non-U.S. governments , and international agencies . The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. FRB policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . As described in Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” a worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , and access to credit or the trading price of our common stock . 15 Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition . Liquidity , or ready access to funds , is essential to our business . A compromise to our liquidity could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets , diminished access to debt or equity markets , unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments . Our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries . These subsidiaries may require access to funds in order to meet certain capital and regulatory requirements . Therefore , these subsidiaries may , in some instances , not be able to pay dividends to fund the obligations of the parent including debt obligations and dividend payments . If existing sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs , we may have to seek additional outside financing or scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders and reducing our operating expenses . The availability of outside financing , including access to the capital markets and bank lending , depends on a variety of factors , such as market conditions , the general availability of credit , the volume of trading activities , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . As a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically , lenders may from time to time curtail , or even cease , to provide funding to borrowers . A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements . As such , we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk . We are exposed to market risk . We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding – which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that change from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . Certain of our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk . We are exposed to credit risk . We are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our broker-dealer businesses exposing us to credit risk in the event of default . Although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction , we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date . We also hold securities and derivatives in our trading accounts . Deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities , or the non-performance of issuers and counterparties to derivative contracts could result in trading losses . 16 We borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers , and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities . A sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments . We deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs , and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients . A failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity , result in significant reputational damage , and impact financial performance . We also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including , but not limited to , C & I loans , commercial and residential mortgage loans , home equity lines of credit , and margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities as well as by investing in MBS and CMOs . The credit quality of our loan and investment portfolios held at RJ Bank can have a significant impact on earnings and overall financial performance . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated to borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries , geographies , or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The deterioration of an individually large exposure could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charges-offs , or credit impairment of our investments , and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank . Continued declines in the real estate market or a sustained economic downturn may cause us to have to further write down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of RJ Bank ’ s available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk . Our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products and on fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries . A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions , we may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . Assets under management balances are impacted by net inflow/outflow of client assets and market values . Below market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition . If we experience losses of managed accounts , our fee revenue will decline . In addition , in periods of declining market values , our asset values under management may resultantly decline , which would negatively impact our fee revenues . Our underwriting , market-making , trading , and other business activities place our capital at risk . We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold . From time to time and as part of our underwriting processes , we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry . Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results . 17 We have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash . The soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us . We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise . Any failure , termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . As a result , defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . We have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability . In recent years , our business has experienced increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins . Growth of our business could increase costs and regulatory risks . We may incur significant expenses in connection with expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth . Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal controls procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . 18 We face intense competition . We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services and location and reputation in local markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors . As such , to compete effectively we must attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . We compete directly with national full service broker-dealers , investment banking firms , and commercial banks , and to a lesser extent , with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors . In addition , we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms . Domestic commercial banks and investment banking boutique firms have entered the broker-dealer business , and large international banks are now serving our markets as well . Legislative and regulatory initiatives which eased restrictions on the sales of securities and underwriting activities by commercial banks have increased competition . We also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies , real estate firms , hedge funds , and others . This increased competition could cause our business to suffer . Competition for personnel within the financial services industry is intense . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably , as competition for these professionals has intensified . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee 's decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee 's decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases , we may have to devote significantly more resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors . Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us . To remain competitive , our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services . In addition , the adoption of new internet , networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure . An inability to develop new products and services , or enhance existing offerings , could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Damage to our reputation could damage our businesses . Maintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers , investors and employees . If we fail to deal with , or appear to fail to deal with , various issues that may give rise to reputational risk , we could harm our business prospects . These issues include , but are not limited to , appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest , legal and regulatory requirements , ethical issues , money-laundering , privacy , record-keeping , sales and trading practices , failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , and the proper identification of the legal , reputational , credit , liquidity , and market risks inherent in our products . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also result in harm to our prospects . 19 We are exposed to operational risk . Our diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events . Our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards , business disruption or system failures and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . Our businesses depend on technology . Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables the firm to reduce costs . Adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements , client needs , and competitive demands is critical for our business . Introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis . There are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications , including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards . Our continued success will depend , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to our reputation . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , the computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to human error , natural disasters , power loss , spam attacks , unauthorized access , distributed denial of service ( “ DDOS ” ) attacks , computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our own or our clients ’ or counterparties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . Extraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes , could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . While we have made investments to upgrade the reliability and scalability of our systems and added hardware to address extraordinary volumes , there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances . Systems failures and delays could occur and could cause , among other things , unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients , slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire , decreased levels for client service and client satisfactions and harm to our reputation . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing these types of operational risk . Our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions . Our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions , communications and the ability of our associates to get to our offices or work from home . 20 We are exposed to litigation risks . Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising from the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability for us . Advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances . Such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor . To the extent we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them , we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers , which could harm our reputation and business . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . In highly volatile markets , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ' investment objectives ( including auction rate securities ) , the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report regarding our approach to managing legal risk . The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results . The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . Conditions in the real estate and credit markets increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies , ” for additional information on the nature of these estimates . Certain of our financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities , certain available for sale securities , certain loans and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Policies ” discussion within Item 7 of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 21 Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk . We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms ; however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report . We are exposed to risk from international markets . We do business in other parts of the world , including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and , as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , reputational , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . Action or inaction in any of these operations , including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance , could harm our operations and/or our reputation . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Additionally , a political , economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generally . We have risks related to our insurance programs . Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , errors and omissions liability , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk , we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency , nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages . Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable . In addition , insurance claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business . 22 RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT Changes in regulations resulting from either the Dodd-Frank act or any new regulations may affect our businesses . The market and economic conditions over the past few years have led to relatively new legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry , including significant additional legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately , while the details of many provisions are subject to additional studies and final rule writing by various applicable regulatory agencies . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy can not be known until all such rules and regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized and implemented . The Dodd-Frank Act may impact the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and its operations and interact with regulators , all of which while not currently anticipated to , could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business include , but are not limited to : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers , regulatory oversight of incentive compensation , the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us . Additionally , we are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the “ Volcker Rule. ” The Volcker Rule is a specific part of the Dodd-Frank Act originally proposed to restrict U.S. banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments that do not benefit their customers . When the regulations are final , we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities to make plans to implement compliance with the Volcker Rule , which will likely not require full conformance until July 2014 , subject to extensions . We operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition . The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including , but not limited to , sales and trading methods , trade practices among broker-dealers , use and safekeeping of customers ’ funds and securities , capital structure of securities firms , anti-money laundering efforts , record keeping and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . If laws or regulations are violated , we could be subject to one or more of the following : civil liability , criminal liability , sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations . Our banking operations also expose us to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws . Our banking operations may be required to increase its regulatory capital and be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums , including special assessments , due to the impact market developments over the past few years have had on the insurance fund of the FDIC . As a holding company of RJ Bank , we are subject to regulation by the FRB . This regulatory oversight includes , but is not limited to , scrutiny with respect to transactions between our domestic subsidiary bank and its affiliates as well as examination of our activities for potential conflicts of interest through detailed review of specific transactions . 23 The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The proposed changes are subject to public comment which ended November 5 , 2010 and , following any adoption which the SEC staff has stated will not occur until 2012 , would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , the impact of changes such as those currently proposed can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . We may also be adversely affected as a result of other changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . See the section entitled “ Business – Regulation ” within Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse affect on our business , financial condition or results of operation or cause us serious reputational harm . Failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements would significantly harm our business . We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and the net capital rule of FINRA , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canada based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction . RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by bank regulators . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could harm RJ Bank ’ s operations and our financial condition . As RJF is a holding company , it depends on dividends , distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including , among others , debt service . Regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within this report for further information on regulations and capital requirements . Our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we expect to become subject as a result of becoming a financial holding company . In September 2008 , we announced that we would seek approval from the FRB to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company ; RJ Bank ’ s application to convert its charter to that of a nationally chartered bank is still pending approval . We anticipate approval of the application to convert RJ Bank ’ s charter before the end of the calendar year . RJF re-filed its application to become a bank holding company at the request of the FRB in November , 2011 . We anticipate approval before the end of the calendar year . Although we have a statutory grace period of two years , with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of up to five years , to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies , and although we expect to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which we currently engage after such time , it is possible that certain of our existing activities will be deemed to be impermissible under applicable regulations . In addition , as a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the FRB , we will become subject to the FRB ’ s risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements . See the section entitled “ Business – Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information . 24 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile . The market price of our common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be , volatile and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with recent economic conditions and may again experience such pressures in the future . Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry , as well as geopolitical , economic and business factors unrelated to us , may also affect our stock price . Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition . Our current shareholders may experience dilution in their holdings if we issue additional shares of common stock as a result of future offerings or acquisitions where we use our common stock . As part of our business strategy , we may seek opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions in which we may consider issuing equity securities as part of the consideration . Additionally , we may obtain additional capital through the public sale of equity securities . If we sell equity securities , the value of our common stock could experience dilution . Furthermore , these securities could have rights , preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the common stock . Moreover , if we issue additional shares of common stock in connection with equity compensation , future acquisitions , or as a result of financing , an investor ’ s ownership interest in our company will be diluted . The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock , or the exercise of such securities , could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock . Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and , therefore , such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders . The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales or issuance of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock . Our officers , directors and employees own a substantial amount of our common stock and therefore exercise significant control over our corporate governance and affairs , which may result in their taking actions with which other shareholders do not agree . Our executive officers , directors and employees control approximately 34 % of our outstanding common stock ( including restricted stock and exercisable stock options which they hold ) . These shareholders , if they act together , may be able to exercise substantial influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders , including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions , which may result in corporate action with which other shareholders do not agree . This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that might affect the market price of our common stock , given that our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote to approve any of the specified types of business combinations . 25 ITEM 1B .

BUSINESS SEGMENTS We have eight business segments : Private Client Group ; Capital Markets ; Asset Management ; RJ Bank ; Emerging Markets ; Stock Loan/Borrow ; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities combined in the Other segment . Our financial information for each of the fiscal years ended September 30 , 2010 , September 30 , 2009 , and September 30 , 2008 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto . PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP We provide securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately 1.9 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ & A , RJFS , RJFSA , RJ Ltd. and Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS '' ) , a joint venture in the United Kingdom . Our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third-party and proprietary products , and a variety of financial planning services . We charge sales commissions or asset-based fees for investment services we provide to our Private Client Group clients based on established schedules . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . In fiscal year 2010 , asset-based fees , including mutual fund and insurance trail annuity commissions , represented 54 % of the Private Client Group 's commissions and fees . The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly-owned subsidiary of RJ & A . Through the financial advisors of our broker-dealer subsidiaries , PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage . 2 Our financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load funds . RJ & A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers . The cost of owning mutual funds typically includes commissions , management fees , operating expenses and distribution fees . Private Client Group Securities Commissions and Fees For the Fiscal Years Ended September 30 , 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total 2008 Total ( in 000 ’ s ) Equities $ 251,820 16 % $ 230,121 18 % $ 246,705 16 % Fixed Income Products 68,867 4 % 76,144 6 % 54,097 4 % Mutual Funds 419,262 26 % 296,109 23 % 379,964 25 % Fee-Based Accounts 551,107 35 % 412,638 33 % 562,442 37 % Insurance and Annuity Products 234,474 15 % 202,712 16 % 219,878 14 % New Issue Sales Credits 59,841 4 % 45,086 4 % 69,204 4 % Total Private Client Group Commissions And Fees $ 1,585,371 100 % $ 1,262,810 100 % $ 1,532,290 100 % Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances , predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations , less interest paid on customer cash balances ( “ Client Interest Program ” ) . Beginning in September 2009 , we began a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue in lieu of interest revenue . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues . Clients ' transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis . RJ & A makes margin loans to clients , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJ & A , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJ & A exceeds RJ & A 's cost of short-term funds . The interest charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client 's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJ & A 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business .

We maintain computer capacity to support mission critical functions at our Southfield location , and conduct some of our daily operational activities from that site . Systems have been designed so that we can transfer all mission critical processing activities to Southfield . Personnel have been identified who are assigned responsibility for this role , including some personnel who will be required to temporarily relocate to Southfield to carry out these activities if necessary . CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets activities consist primarily of equity and fixed income products and services . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . Institutional Sales Institutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment 's revenue , which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities . Our institutional clients are serviced by the RJ & A and RJ Ltd. Institutional Equity Departments , the RJ & A Fixed Income Department , RJ & A ’ s European offices and Raymond James Financial International Ltd , an institutional UK broker-dealer located in London .

The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios and mutual funds . Investment advisory fees are also earned on assets held in managed programs . These fees are computed based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter , the end of the quarter , or average assets . Consistent with industry practice , fees from private client investment portfolios are typically based on asset values at the beginning of the period while institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the period . Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and the new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds . Increasing markets positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value , and individuals and institutions typically commit incremental funds in rising markets . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . Eagle Asset Management , Inc. Eagle is a registered investment advisor with $ 15.6 billion under management as of September 30 , 2010 . Eagle offers a variety of equity and fixed income objectives managed by a number of portfolio management teams and a subsidiary investment advisor , Eagle Boston Investment Management , Inc.

Eagle also serves as investment advisor to the Eagle Family of Funds . Eagle ’ s assets under management are comprised of 60 % institutional assets , including funds managed as a sub-advisor to variable annuity accounts and mutual funds , and 40 % private client assets . The investment management fee paid to Eagle for discretionary accounts generally ranges from 0.20 % to 1.00 % of asset balances per year depending upon the size , nature and investment objective ( s ) of the account . Additionally , performance fees may be earned for performing above respective benchmarks . Eagle Fund Distributors , Inc. , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eagle ( “ EFD ” ) , is a registered broker-dealer engaged in the distribution of the Eagle Family of Funds . The Eagle Family of Funds utilizes unaffiliated sub-advisors for the Capital Appreciation Trust , Growth and Income Fund and the International Equity Fund . The Small Cap Growth Fund , Mid Cap Growth Fund , Large Cap Core Fund , Mid Cap Stock Fund , Investment Grade Bond Fund , and Small Cap Core Value Fund are managed by Eagle . Eagle closed its money market funds during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 . Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through an unrelated third-party . Asset Management Services AMS manages several investment advisory programs . Raymond James Consulting Services and the Eagle High Net Worth programs maintain an approved list of investment managers , provide asset allocation model portfolios , establish custodial facilities , monitor performance of client accounts , provide clients with accounting and other administrative services , and assist investment managers with certain trading management activities . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.35 % to 0.85 % of asset balances per annum , a portion of which is paid to the investment managers who direct the investment of the clients ' accounts . In addition , AMS offers accounts managed within fee-based asset allocation platforms under our Freedom and other managed programs . Freedom ’ s investment committee manages portfolios of separately managed accounts , mutual funds and exchange traded funds on a discretionary basis . AMS earns fees generally ranging from 0.10 % to 0.40 % of asset balances per annum . At September 30 , 2010 , these managed programs had $ 18 billion in assets under management , including $ 3.5 billion managed by Eagle . For Passport , Ambassador and other non-managed fee-based accounts , AMS provides performance reporting , research , sales , accounting and other administrative services . Advisory services are provided by Private Client Group financial advisors . Fees are based on the individual account size and are also dependent on the type of securities in the accounts . Total client fees generally range from 0.50 % to 3.00 % of assets , and are predominantly allocated to the Private Client Group . As of September 30 , 2010 , these programs had $ 35.2 billion in assets . RJFS offers a similar advisory fee-based program called IMPAC . As of September 30 , 2010 , IMPAC had $ 9.3 billion in assets serviced by RJFS financial advisors . In addition to the foregoing programs , AMS also administers fee-based programs for clients who have contracted for portfolio management services from non-affiliated investment advisors that are not part of the Raymond James Consulting Services program . 7 Raymond James Trust , National Association Raymond James Trust , National Association , ( “ RJT ” ) provides personal trust services primarily to existing clients of the broker-dealer subsidiaries . Portfolio management of trust assets is often subcontracted to our asset management operations . This subsidiary had a total of approximately $ 1.7 billion in client assets at September 30 , 2010 , including $ 108 million in the donor-advised charitable foundation known as the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund . RAYMOND JAMES BANK , FSB RJ Bank is a federally chartered savings bank , regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision ( “ OTS ” ) , which provides residential , consumer and corporate loans , as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) insured deposit accounts , to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public . RJ Bank also purchases residential whole loan packages to hold for investment and is active in bank participations and corporate loan syndications . RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank ’ s net interest revenues . RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to our headquarters complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank 's products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through telephonic and electronic banking services . RJ Bank ’ s assets include commercial and residential real estate loans , corporate loans secured by other corporate assets , as well as consumer loans that were purchased or originated by RJ Bank . Corporate loans represent approximately 67 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio and 90 % of the corporate portfolio is comprised of Shared National Credits ( “ SNC ” ) or other large syndicated loans . SNCs are loan syndications totaling over $ 20 million that are shared among three or more regulated institutions . Purchased loans originated by select large financial institutions represent over 90 % of RJ Bank ’ s residential mortgage loan portfolio . RJ Bank ’ s total liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts maintained at RJ & A . In September 2009 , RJ & A revised that cash sweep program from a single-bank ( RJ Bank ) to a multi-bank ( RJ Bank and other non-affiliated banks ) program . Under the revised program hereinafter referred to as the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third-party service into interest bearing deposit accounts ( $ 245,000 per bank for individual accounts and $ 490,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This program enables clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual FDIC deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) in addition to competitive rates for their cash balances . RJ Bank does not have any significant concentrations with any one industry or customer ( see table of industry concentration in Item 7A , “ Market Risk ” ) . EMERGING MARKETS Raymond James International Holdings , Inc. ( “ RJIH ” ) , through its subsidiaries , currently has interests in various joint ventures operating in Latin American countries including Argentina , Uruguay and Brazil . Through these entities we operate securities brokerage , investment banking , asset management and equity research businesses . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . STOCK LOAN/BORROW This activity involves the borrowing and lending of securities from and to other broker-dealers , financial institutions and other counterparties , generally as an intermediary . The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned . Accordingly , the lender receives cash and pays interest . These cash deposits are adjusted daily to reflect changes in current market value of the underlying securities . The net revenues of this operation are the interest spreads generated . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . PROPRIETARY CAPITAL This segment consists of our principal capital and private equity activities including : various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments , short-term special situations and bridge investments ( “ Special Situations Investments ” ) , Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II ( the “ EIF Funds ” ) , and a private equity fund which we sponsor : Raymond James Capital Partners , L.P. As of September 30 , 2010 , certain of our merchant banking investments include an investment in : a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies , an event photography business , and an indirect investment in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company . 8 We participate in profits or losses through both general and limited partnership interests . Additionally , we incur profits or losses as a result of direct merchant banking investments and Special Situations Investments . The EIF Funds are limited partnerships , for which we are the general partner , that invest in our merchant banking and private equity activities and other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships . The EIF Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees . OTHER This segment includes various corporate overhead costs , including interest expense on our senior debt issued in August , 2009 . COMPETITION We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business . The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The U.S. government recently enacted financial services reform legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act ( “ Dodd-Frank Act ” ) . Because of the nature of our business and business practices , we do not expect this legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations . However , because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies and are yet to be written by the various regulatory agencies , the impact is uncertain . Under the new legislation , as a holding company of RJ Bank , we will become subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the “ FRB ” ) . We anticipate that this change in our regulator will become effective in mid-2011 . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . 9 Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments to replenish the reserves . In anticipation of inadequate SIPC fund levels during the current economic environment , certain of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries will be required to pay 0.25 % of net operating revenues , as defined by SIPC , as a special assessment . During fiscal year 2010 , $ 3.1 million has been incurred to satisfy this special assessment . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 250,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor ’ s and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund . The additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC . RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1 million per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . We are a “ unitary savings and loan holding company ” as defined by federal law , because we own one savings association , RJ Bank . For the periods through and including September 30 , 2010 , we were under the supervision of , and subject to the rules , regulations , and periodic examination by , the OTS . Additionally , RJ Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FRB and the FDIC . Collectively , these rules and regulations cover all aspects of the banking business including lending practices , safeguarding deposits , capital structure , transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel . Since we were a savings and loan holding company prior to May 4 , 1999 , we are exempt from certain restrictions that would otherwise apply under federal law to the activities and investments of a savings and loan holding company . These restrictions would become applicable to us if RJ Bank fails to meet a qualified thrift lender ( “ QTL ” ) test established by federal law . As of September 30 , 2010 , RJ Bank was in compliance with QTL standards according to the Domestic Building and Loan Association ( “ DBLA ” ) test . This test requires RJ Bank to meet a “ business operations test ” and a point-in-time “ 60 % of assets test ” on the last day of each fiscal year . The business operations test requires the business to consist primarily of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans . The 60 % of assets test requires that at least 60 % of the assets consist of qualifying assets that thrifts normally hold pursuant to regulations . As of September 30 , 2010 , RJ Bank met the business operations test and the 60 % of assets test with 62 % of qualifying assets . In order to meet this point-in-time percentage of assets requirement , RJ Bank held an additional $ 3.5 billion in qualifying assets , which was funded by a $ 2.4 billion overnight Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( “ FHLB ” ) advance , deposits of approximately $ 400 million from affiliates , and additional deposits of approximately $ 700 million from the RJBDP . The deposits from affiliates were withdrawn and the FHLB advance was repaid on October 1 , 2010 . The RJBDP deposits were redirected to other RJBDP participating banks during early October , 2010 . The consequences for financial institutions which fail the QTL test include the requirement to either become a national bank or be prohibited from making or engaging in any non-allowable investments or activities , the establishment of new branch offices and the payment of dividends . 10 RJ Bank applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) in November , 2008 to convert to a national bank . This charter conversion also requires , by law , that RJF become a bank holding company . Accordingly , in December 2008 , RJF applied to the FRB to become a bank holding company . To-date , these applications have not been acted upon by these agencies . RJ Bank will become subject to regulation ( including periodic examinations ) by the OCC upon the earlier of its conversion to a national bank , or the transfer of the duties of the OTS to the OCC , which has been mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act . At any given point in time , the regulation of RJ Bank will be dictated by the nature of its charter ( federal thrift or national bank ) . Upon conversion from a thrift to a national bank charter , RJ Bank would no longer be subject to the QTL requirement . RJ Bank anticipates that its application will be acted upon after the transfer of the duties of the OTS to the OCC . RJF will then become a bank holding company and can elect to become a financial holding company . We anticipate that this change in RJ Bank ’ s regulator will become effective in mid-2011 . RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJ Bank 's financial statements and consequently ours . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information . In addition , since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . Our federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT ’ s fiduciary services . As a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors , the structure of our Audit Committee , and ethical standards for our senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . The Dodd-Frank Act also contains a number of provisions imposing governance standards , including those regarding “ Say-on-Pay ” votes for shareholders , incentive compensation clawbacks , compensation committee independence and disclosure concerning executive compensation , employee and director hedging and chairman and CEO positions . Most of these provisions will require the SEC to issue final regulations . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain an opinion from our independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting . 11 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Executive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows and the trading price of our common stock . 13 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY We Are Affected by Difficult Conditions in the Global Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by economic and political conditions . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to our operating results , including the inflation rate , the related impact on the securities markets including changes in volume and price levels of securities , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , reduced investor confidence , and a slowdown in economic activity . These conditions historically have impacted our trading volume and net revenues and affected our profitability . Additionally , a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand . Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades we execute for our clients , a decline in the value of securities we hold in inventory as assets , and potentially reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which we participate . In addition , declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios , and may result in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations , as well as the failure of our clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans , we may lose money on these margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . Dramatic declines in the real estate market over the past few years , with increasing foreclosures and unemployment , have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as commercial and investment banks . These write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities , have in turn caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases , to fail . RJ Bank is particularly affected by domestic economic conditions . Such conditions include : U.S. interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect corporate loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the U.S. , non-U.S. governments , and international agencies . The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. FRB policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets , most notably debt securities . Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . As described in Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources ” , a worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , access to credit or the trading price of our common stock . 14 Lack of Liquidity or Access to Capital Could Impair Our Business and Financial Condition Liquidity , or ready access to funds , is essential to our business . A compromise to our liquidity could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets , diminished access to debt or equity markets , unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments ( including , among others , risks associated with auction rate securities ) . Our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries . These subsidiaries may require access to funds in order to maintain certain capital and regulatory requirements . Therefore , these subsidiaries may , in some instances , not be able to pay dividends to fund the obligations of the parent including debt obligations and dividend payments . If existing sources of liquidity resources do not satisfy our needs , we may have to seek additional outside financing or scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders and reducing our operating expenses . The availability of outside financing , including access to the capital markets and bank lending , depends on a variety of factors , such as market conditions , the general availability of credit , the volume of trading activities , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically , many lenders have reduced , and in some cases , ceased to provide funding to borrowers , us included . As a result , we sold $ 300 million in senior notes in a registered underwritten public offering in August 2009 . A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , further limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements . As such , we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources ” for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk . We are Exposed to Market Risk We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding – which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that may shift from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , relative exchange rates , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . Certain of our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk . 15 We are Exposed to Credit Risk We are exposed to the risk that third-parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will not perform their obligations . These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We engage in trading and funding transactions with various counterparties . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Deterioration in the credit quality of third-parties who are indebted to us could result in losses . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The credit quality of our loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings . Although no significant credit concentrations exist , the deterioration of an individually large loan exposure could lead to additional loan loss provisions and/or charge-offs and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank . Due to the size of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , credit risk at RJ Bank is significant to our overall financial performance . Continued declines in the real estate market or a sustained economic downturn may cause us to have to further write-down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write-down the value of some of RJ Bank ’ s available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk . Our Business Depends on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts by Our Asset Management Subsidiaries A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses , or increased investor redemptions , we may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . In addition , changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . If we experience losses of managed accounts , our fees will decline . In addition , the relative investment performance of these accounts could impact our ability to attract and retain clients and thus affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Our Underwriting , Market Making , Trading , and Other Business Activities Place Our Capital at Risk We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that , for any reason , we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels . As an underwriter , we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite . As a market maker , we may own positions in specific securities , and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified . In addition , we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold . We have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments , which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded . There is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy . In particular , these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made , changes in economic conditions or changes in laws , regulations , fiscal policies or political conditions . It could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale . Even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable , it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash . 16 The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions and Intermediaries Affects Us We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . In recent years there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , which has increased our exposure to certain financial intermediaries and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in such events . Any such failure , termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . As a result , defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . We Have Experienced Significant Pricing Pressures in Areas of Our Business , Which May Impair Our Future Revenue and Profitability In recent years , our business has experienced significant pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading . In the fixed income market , regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency , leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins . In the equity market , we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions , and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading , which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins . We believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay , including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use , and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees , commissions or margins . Growth of Our Business Could Increase Costs and Regulatory Risks We may incur significant expenses in connection with expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions , or investments , if and to the extent they arise from time to time . Our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth . Expansion may also create a need for additional compliance , documentation , risk management and internal controls procedures , and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures . To the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business , we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction . We Face Intense Competition We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services and location and reputation in local markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . Because of continued market unrest and increased government intervention , this trend toward consolidation has intensified . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors . As such , to compete effectively , we must attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . 17 Competition for personnel within the financial services industry is intense . The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably , as competition for these professionals has intensified . Employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts , upfront payments , and increased compensation . These can be important factors in a current employee 's decision to leave us as well as a prospective employee 's decision to join us . As competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases , we may have to devote significantly more resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel . In particular , our financial results may be adversely affected by the amortization costs incurred by us in connection with the upfront loans we offer to financial advisors . Moreover , companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices . We have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel , some of whom may currently be working for our competitors . Some of these claims may result in material litigation . We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims , regardless of their merits . Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us . Damage to our Reputation Could Damage our Businesses Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers , investors and employees . Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects . Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources , including , among others , employee misconduct , litigation or regulatory outcomes , failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality , compliance failures , failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels , unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also result in harm to our prospects . We Are Exposed to Operational Risk Our diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events . Our business depends on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards , business disruption or system failures and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . In addition , significant operational loss could damage our reputation . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . 18 Our Business Depends on Technology Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms to reduce costs . Our continued success will depend , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to our reputation . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , the computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access , computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our own or our clients ’ or counterparties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third-parties ’ operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing this type of operational risk . We Are Exposed to Litigation Risks Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising from the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability for us . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . In turbulent times such as these , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ' investment objectives ( including auction rate securities ) , the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . We have received inquiries from the SEC , FINRA and several state regulatory authorities requesting information concerning our sale of auction rate securities to our customers . We have also been named in civil class action lawsuits relating to sales of auction rate securities . We are working with other industry participants in order to resolve issues relating to auction rate securities and are exploring a range of potential solutions . If we were to determine , in order to resolve pending claims , inquiries or investigations , to repurchase at par value auction rate securities from certain of our clients , we would be required to assess whether we have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to do so , and there can be no assurance that we would have such capacity . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters ( including auction rate securities ) and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding our approach to managing legal risk . 19 The Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements Requires the Use of Estimates that May Vary From Actual Results and New Accounting Standards Could Adversely Affect Future Reported Results The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( “ GAAP ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . The current condition of the real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies ” for additional information on the sensitivity of these estimates . Certain of our financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities , certain available for sale securities , certain loans and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods . Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Policies ” discussion within Item 7 of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms , however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . A failure to adequately manage our growth , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address , or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report . 20 We are Exposed to Risk from International Markets We do business in other parts of the world , including in a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets , and as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , reputational , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified , because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . Our Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions Our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions and communications . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex . We have also developed a business continuity plan for our Private Client Group branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather . Each branch is assigned a “ contingency branch ” in another part of the country that allows the impacted branch the ability to communicate through the contingency branch . We have Self-insurance Risks Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks including most significantly : property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund , among others . RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT Recent Changes in Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act May Affect Our Businesses Recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry , including significant additional legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad . The Dodd-Frank Act calls for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants , reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading , enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures , and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors . Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately , though the details of many provisions are subject to additional studies and will not be known until final rules are adopted by applicable regulatory agencies . The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us , the financial industry and the economy can not be known until all such rules and regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized . The Dodd-Frank Act may impact the manner in which we market our products and services , manage our business and its operations and interact with regulators , all of which while not currently anticipated to , could materially impact our results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business include but are not limited to : the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers , the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent , greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading . To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act impacts the operations , financial condition , liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business , those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs , reduce their capacity to transact , or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us . 21 We Operate in a Highly Regulated Industry in which Future Developments Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Condition The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . If laws or regulations are violated , we could be subject to one or more of the following : civil liability , criminal liability , sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business . Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . The majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors . Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors , and our business , resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations . Our banking operations also expose us to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws . Our banking operations may be required to increase its regulatory capital and be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums , including additional special assessments , due to the continued impact market developments have had on the insurance fund of the FDIC . Proposals for further regulation of financial institutions , both domestically and internationally , include calls to increase their capital and liquidity requirements ; limit the size and types of the activities permitted ; and increase taxes on some institutions . The SEC has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares . The proposed changes are subject to public comment and , following any enactment , would be phased in over a number of years . As these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry , the impact of changes such as those currently proposed can not be predicted at this time . As this regulatory trend continues , it could adversely affect our operations and , in turn , our financial results . We may also be adversely affected as a result of other changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . See the section entitled “ Business – Regulation ” within Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse affect on our business , financial condition or results of operation , or cause us serious reputational harm . Failure to Comply with Regulatory Capital Requirements Would Significantly Harm Our Business We are subject to the SEC ’ s uniform net capital rule ( Rule 15c3-1 ) and the net capital rule of FINRA , which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . The uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid . FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements . In addition , our Canadian-based broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction . RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I Capital to adjusted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory , and possibly additional discretionary , actions by regulators that if undertaken , could harm RJ Bank ’ s operations and our financial condition . See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this report for further information on regulations and capital requirements . 22 As RJF is a holding company , we depend on dividends , distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments of our obligations including , among others , debt service . These regulatory restrictions may impede access to funds our holding company needs to make payments on any such obligations . Our Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by New Regulations to Which We Expect to Become Subject as a Result of Becoming a Financial Holding Company In September 2008 , we announced that we would seek approval from the FRB to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company ; our application remains pending . Although we have a statutory grace period of two years , with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of up to five years , to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies , and although we expect to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which we currently engage after such time , it is possible that certain of our existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations . In addition , as a financial holding company , we will become subject to the comprehensive , consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB , including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements , and , as a nationally chartered commercial bank , RJ Bank will become subject to regulation ( including periodic examinations ) by the OCC . See the section entitled “ Business –Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information . RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK The Market Price of Our Common Stock May Continue to be Volatile The market price of our common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with the recent economic downturn and may again experience such pressures in the future . Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition . Our Current Shareholders May Experience Dilution in their Holdings if We Issue Additional Shares of Common Stock as a Result of Future Offerings or Acquisitions Where We use Our Common Stock As part of our business strategy , we may seek opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions , in which we may consider issuing equity securities as part of the consideration . Additionally , we may obtain additional capital through the public sale of equity securities . If we sell equity securities , the value of our common stock could experience dilution . Furthermore , these securities could have rights , preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the common stock . Moreover , if we issue additional shares of common stock in connection with equity compensation , future acquisitions or as a result of financing , investor ’ s ownership interest in our company will be diluted . The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock , or the exercise of such securities , could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock . Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and , therefore , such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders . The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales or issuance of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock . Our Officers , Directors and Employees Own a Substantial Amount of Our Common Stock and Therefore Exercise Significant Control over Our Corporate Governance and Affairs , Which May Result in Their Taking Actions with Which Other Shareholders Do Not Agree Our executive officers , directors and employees control approximately 35 % of our outstanding common stock ( including restricted stock and exercisable stock options which they hold ) . These shareholders , if they act together , may be able to exercise substantial influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders , including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions , which may result in corporate action with which other shareholders do not agree . This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that might affect the market price of our common stock , given that our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote to approve any of the specified types of business combinations . 23 ITEM 1B .

In fiscal year 2009 , asset-based fees , including mutual fund and insurance trail annuity commissions , represented 53 % of the Private Client Group 's commissions and fees . The majority of our U.S. financial advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency , Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJ & A . Through the financial advisors of our broker-dealer subsidiaries , PCA provides product and marketing support for a broad range of insurance products , principally fixed and variable annuities , life insurance , disability insurance and long-term care coverage . Our financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load mutual funds , as well as a selection of no-load funds . RJ & A and RJFS maintain dealer sales agreements with most major distributors of mutual fund shares sold through broker-dealers . The majority of mutual fund client purchases include a front-end sales charge or occur at net asset value ( “ NAV ” ) in fee-based accounts . In addition , the cost of owning mutual funds typically includes management fees , operating expenses and distribution fees .

Beginning in September 2009 , we began a multi-bank sweep program which generates fee revenue in lieu of interest revenue . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in this report for information regarding our net interest revenues . Clients ' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJ & A makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJ & A , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJ & A exceeds RJ & A 's cost of short-term funds . The interest charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client 's account . 3 Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJ & A 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business .

RJ Bank also purchases residential whole loan packages and is active in bank participations and corporate loan syndications . RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments , which is offset by the interest expense it incurs on client deposits and on its borrowings . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in this report for financial information regarding RJ Bank ’ s net interest revenues . RJ Bank is in the application process of converting from a federal savings bank to a nationally-chartered commercial bank , which would change its regulator from the OTS to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( “ OCC ” ) . This change also requires that RJF become a bank holding company , as required by law , and then elect to become a financial holding company . Once the financial holding company status is achieved , RJF would be under the regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System . RJ Bank operates from a single branch location adjacent to our headquarters complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Access to RJ Bank 's products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through telephonic and electronic banking services . As of September 30 , 2009 , RJ Bank had total assets of $ 11.1 billion , which included commercial and residential mortgage loans , as well as consumer loans that were originated or purchased by RJ Bank . Corporate loans represent approximately 64 % of RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio and 90 % of the corporate portfolio is comprised of Shared National Credits ( “ SNC ” ) or other large syndicated loans led by approximately 30 different financial institutions . SNCs are loan syndications totaling over $ 20 million that are shared among three or more regulated institutions . Purchased loans originated by select large financial institutions represent over 90 % of RJ Bank ’ s residential loan portfolio .

Under the revised program , clients ’ cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are re-deposited through a third party service into interest bearing deposit accounts ( $ 245,000 per bank for individual accounts and $ 490,000 for joint accounts ) at up to 12 banks . This change allows clients to obtain up to $ 2.5 million in individual FDIC deposit insurance coverage ( $ 5 million for joint accounts ) in addition to more competitive rates for their cash balances .

The EIF Funds were established as compensation and retention vehicles for certain of our qualified key employees . OTHER This segment includes various corporate overhead costs of ours , including interest cost on our senior debt . COMPETITION We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . We also compete with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our customers and the securities markets , our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from our broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business . The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJ & A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . We have offices in Europe , Canada and Latin America . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . 10 Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments to replenish the reserves . In anticipation of inadequate SIPC fund levels during the current economic environment , each of our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries will be required to pay 0.25 % of net operating revenues as a special assessment . For fiscal year 2009 , $ 1.4 million has been accrued to satisfy this special assessment . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . We have purchased excess SIPC coverage through various syndicates of Lloyd ’ s , a London-based firm that holds an “ A+ ” rating from Standard and Poor ’ s and Fitch Ratings . Excess SIPC is fully protected by the Lloyd ’ s trust funds and Lloyd ’ s Central Fund . The additional protection currently provided has an aggregate firm limit of $ 750 million , including a sub-limit of $ 1.9 million per customer for cash above basic SIPC for the wrongful abstraction of customer funds . Account protection applies when a SIPC member fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to clients , but it does not protect against market fluctuations . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs , which are responsible for the enforcement of , and conformity with , securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs and the IIROC . RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 1.0 % of revenue or a risk-based assessment . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1 million per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . Our investment advisory operations , including the mutual funds that we sponsor , are also subject to extensive regulation . Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients . We are a “ unitary savings and loan holding company ” as defined by federal law , because we own one savings association , RJ Bank , and we are under the supervision of , and subject to periodic examination by , the OTS . Since we were a savings and loan holding company prior to May 4 , 1999 , we are exempt from certain restrictions that would otherwise apply under federal law to the activities and investments of a savings and loan holding company . These restrictions would become applicable to us if RJ Bank fails to meet a qualified thrift lender ( “ QTL ” ) test established by federal law . As of September 30 , 2009 , RJ Bank was in compliance with QTL standards according to the Domestic Building and Loan Association ( “ DBLA ” ) test . This test requires RJ Bank to meet a “ business operations test ” and a point in time “ 60 % of assets test ” on the last day of each fiscal year . The business operations test requires the business to consist primarily of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans . The 60 % of assets test requires that at least 60 % of the assets consist of qualifying assets that thrifts normally hold pursuant to regulations . As of September 30 , 2009 , RJ Bank met the business operations test and the 60 % of assets test with 62 % of qualifying assets . RJ Bank borrowed $ 900 million in overnight Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( “ FHLB ” ) advances and received additional deposits of $ 2.3 billion from the Raymond James Bank Deposit Program ( “ RJBDP ” ) , which were then invested , $ 1.2 billion in U.S. Treasury securities and $ 2 billion in reverse repurchase agreements ( collateralized by Government National Mortgage Association ( “ GNMA ” ) and U.S. Treasury securities ) . RJ Bank repaid the borrowings on October 1 , 2009 and the majority of the RJBDP deposits were redirected during October 2009 to third-party banks participating in the multi-bank sweep program . The consequences for financial institutions which fail the QTL test include the requirement to either become a national bank or be prohibited from making or engaging in any non-allowable investments or activities , the establishment of new branch offices and the payment of dividends . RJ Bank has applied to convert to a national bank . Upon conversion from a thrift to a national bank charter , RJ Bank ’ s QTL requirement would be eliminated . 11 RJ Bank is under the supervision of , and subject to periodic examination by , the OTS , and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OTS , the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC . When the conversion to a national bank charter is completed , RJ Bank will be subject to periodic examination by the OCC , and subject to the rules and regulations applicable to national banks . In addition , since RJ Bank provides products covered by FDIC insurance , RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJ Bank 's financial statements and consequently ours . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank 's assets , liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJ Bank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier I capital to adjusted total assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . Our federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of RJT ’ s fiduciary services . As a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , we are subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of our Board of Directors , the structure of our Audit Committee , and ethical standards for our senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , we are required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on our Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , we are required to assess our internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain a report from our independent auditors regarding their opinion of our internal controls over financial reporting . We have incurred additional costs in order to comply with the Act , reflecting internal staff and management time , as well as additional audit fees since the Act went into effect . 12 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Executive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements . In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor , we caution readers that a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements . These risks and uncertainties , many of which are beyond our control , are discussed in Item 1A , “ Risk Factors ” in this report . We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . 14 ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows and the trading price of our common stock . We Are Affected by Difficult Conditions in the Global Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally We are engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , we are affected by economic and political conditions . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to our operating results , including the inflation rate and the related impact on the securities markets , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , reduced investor confidence , a slowdown in economic activity and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets . These conditions historically have impacted our trading volume and net revenues and affected our profitability . Additionally , a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand . Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades we execute for our clients , a further decline in the value of securities we hold in inventory as assets , and continued reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which we participate . In addition , declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios , and may result in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations , and in the failure of our clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations . During market downturns , our counterparties may be less likely to complete transactions . Also , we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans , we may lose money on these margin transactions . This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . Dramatic declines in the real estate market over the past two years , with increasing foreclosures and unemployment , have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by other financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks . These write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities , have in turn caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases , to fail . Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties , many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide or have reduced funding to even the most credit-worthy borrowers . These lender concerns are particularly severe with respect to financial institution borrowers . RJ Bank is particularly affected by domestic economic conditions . Such conditions include : U.S. interest rates , the rate of unemployment , real estate prices , the level of consumer confidence , changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies , among others . The deterioration of these conditions can diminish loan demand , lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies , affect corporate loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs , which can adversely affect our earnings . Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States , non-U.S. governments and international agencies . The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( “ FRB ” ) regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States . FRB policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments . The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold , such as debt securities and loans . Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and , consequently , the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict . As described in Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources ” , the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could continue to materially and adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , access to credit or the trading price of our common stock . 15 Lack of Liquidity or Access to Capital Could Impair Our Business and Financial Condition Liquidity , or ready access to funds , is essential to our business . A compromise to our liquidity could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets , diminished access to debt or equity markets , unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments ( including , among others , risks associated with auction rate securities ) . Our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries . These subsidiaries require access to funds in order to maintain certain capital and regulatory requirements . Therefore , these subsidiaries may , in some instances , not be able to pay dividends to fund the obligations of the parent including debt obligations and dividend payments . If existing sources of liquidity resources do not satisfy our needs , we may have to seek additional outside financing or scale back or curtail our operations , including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us , cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders and reducing our operating expenses . The availability of outside financing , including access to the capital markets and bank lending , depends on a variety of factors , such as market conditions , the general availability of credit , the volume of trading activities , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings . Our cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically , many lenders have reduced , and in some cases , ceased to provide funding to borrowers , us included . As a result , we sold $ 300 million in senior notes in a registered underwritten public offering in August 2009 . A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our incremental borrowing costs , further limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements . As such , we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms , or at all . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources ” for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk . We are Exposed to Market Risk We are , directly and indirectly , affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding – which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments . Market conditions that may shift from time to time , thereby exposing us to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . Certain of our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings . The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict . When , and if , we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors , including general economic conditions , the prospects of the companies in which we invest , when these companies go public , the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions . Further , our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses , especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk . 16 We are Exposed to Credit Risk We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will not perform their obligations . These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . We engage in trading and funding transactions with various counterparties . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties who are indebted to us could result in losses . Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities , industries or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions . The credit quality of our loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings . Due to the growth in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio , credit risk at RJ Bank has become more significant to our overall financial performance . Continued declines in the real estate market or a sustained economic downturn may cause us to have to further write-down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank ’ s portfolio , foreclose on certain real estate properties or write-down the value of some of RJ Bank ’ s available for sale securities portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy . Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers , potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk . Our Business Depends on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts by Our Asset Management Subsidiaries A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses , or increased investor redemptions , we may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . In addition , changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . If we experience losses of managed accounts , our fees will decline . In addition , the relative investment performance of these accounts could impact our ability to attract and retain clients and thus affect our revenues , business and financial condition . We Are Exposed to Operational Risk Our diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events . Our business depends on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions . Our financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function or unit of our business , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards , business disruption or system failures and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . In addition , significant operational loss could damage our reputation . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . 17 The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions and Intermediaries Affects Us We face the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions . In recent years there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , which has increased our exposure to certain financial intermediaries and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in such events . Any such failure , termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions , service our clients and manage our exposure to risk . Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading , clearing , funding , counterparty or other relationships . We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties , and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients . As a result , defaults by , or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of , one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions . Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client . In addition , our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us can not be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us . Our Business Depends on Technology Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms to reduce costs . Our continued success will depend , in part , upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems , our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of our systems , which could result from events beyond our control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to our reputation . Our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks . Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , the computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access , computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize our own or our clients ’ or counterparties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations . We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing this type of operational risk . We Face Intense Competition We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses . We compete on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of our financial advisors and associates , our products and services and location and reputation in local markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors . Because of continued market unrest and increased government intervention , this trend toward consolidation has intensified . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors . Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors . As such , to compete effectively , we must attract , retain and motivate qualified associates , including successful financial advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . 18 We Operate in a Highly Regulated Industry in which Future Developments Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Condition The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation , and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . We could be subject to civil liability , criminal liability or sanctions , including revocation of our subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors , censures , fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business , if laws or regulations are violated . Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and prospects . Our banking operations also expose us to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws . In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and the economy , legislators and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry by introducing proposals for new legislation and regulations . We are unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented and in what form , or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations , including the interpretation or implementation thereof , will occur in the future . Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . Our banking operations may be required to increase its regulatory capital and be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums , including special assessments , due to the significant impact market developments have had on the insurance fund of the FDIC . We may also be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . See the section entitled “ Business – Regulation ” within Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk . Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to us , which could have a material adverse affect on our business , financial condition or results of operation , or cause us serious reputational harm . Our Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by New Regulations to Which We Expect to Become Subject as a Result of Becoming a Financial Holding Company In September 2008 , we announced that we would seek approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company . Although we have a statutory grace period of two years , with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of up to five years , to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies , and although we expect to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which we currently engage after such time , it is possible that certain of our existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations . In addition , as a financial holding company , we will become subject to the comprehensive , consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB , including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements , and , as a nationally-chartered commercial bank , RJ Bank will be subject to the functional supervision and regulation of the OCC . See the section entitled “ Business –Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information . We Are Exposed to Litigation Risks Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability , arising from the normal course of business . We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages . The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time . Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability to us . Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses . 19 In turbulent times such as these , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients ' investment objectives ( including auction rate securities ) , the ability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions . We have received inquiries from the SEC , FINRA and several state regulatory authorities requesting information concerning auction rate securities . We have also been named in civil class action lawsuits relating to sales of auction rate securities and disclosures relating to bank reserves , respectively . We are working with other industry participants in order to resolve issues relating to auction rate securities and are exploring a range of potential solutions . If we were to determine , in order to resolve pending claims , inquiries or investigations , to repurchase at par value auction rate securities from certain of our clients , we would be required to assess whether we have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to do so , and there can be no assurance that we would have such capacity . Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects . See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters ( including auction rate securities ) and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding our approach to managing legal risk . Damage to our Reputation Could Damage our Businesses Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers , investors and employees . Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects . Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources , including , among others , employee misconduct , litigation or regulatory outcomes , failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality , compliance failures , unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties . Further , negative publicity regarding us , whether or not true , may also result in harm to our prospects . The Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements Requires the Use of Estimates that May Vary From Actual Results and New Accounting Standards Could Adversely Affect Future Reported Results The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank ’ s allowance for loan losses . The current condition of the real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank ’ s loan portfolio . If management ’ s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses . Our financial condition , including our liquidity and capital , and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies ” for additional information on the sensitivity of these estimates . Certain of our financial instruments , including cash equivalents , certain trading assets and liabilities , certain available for sale securities , certain loans and private equity investments , among other items , require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements . Where quoted market prices are not available , we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment . Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs , making their valuation particularly subjective , being based on significant estimation and judgment . In addition , sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items , which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings . 20 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB ” ) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements . In addition , accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied . These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . In some cases , we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively , resulting in our restating prior period financial statements . For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards , see the “ Critical Accounting Policies ” discussion within Item 7 of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk We seek to manage , monitor and control our operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms , however , there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective . Further , our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . In addition , RJ Bank has undergone significant growth in recent years . A failure to adequately manage the growth of RJ Bank , or to effectively manage our risk , could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition . Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business . We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest . Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . The failure to adequately address , or the perceived failure to adequately address , conflicts of interest could affect our reputation , the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions . Therefore , there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us . For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report . We are Exposed to Risk from International Markets We do business in other parts of the world , including in a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets , and as a result , are exposed to a number of risks , including economic , market , reputational , litigation and regulatory risks , in non-U.S. markets . Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations , social or political instability , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , expropriation , nationalization , confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments . We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified , because generally non-U.S. trading markets , particularly in emerging market countries , are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets . The Market Price of Our Common Stock May Continue to be Volatile The market price of our common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with the current economic downturn and may again experience such pressures in the future . Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition . 21 Our Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions Our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions and communications . Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex . We have also developed a business continuity plan for our Private Client Group branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather . Each branch is assigned a “ contingency branch ” in another part of the country that allows the impacted branch the ability to communicate through the contingency branch . We have Self-insurance Risks Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including , without limitation , property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund .

Private Client Group Securities Commission and Fees For the Fiscal Years Ended : September 30 , % of September 30 , % of September 30 , % of 2008 Total 2007 Total 2006 Total ( $ in 000 's ) Listed Equities $ 187,891 12 % $ 188,120 13 % $ 188,031 15 % OTC Equities 58,814 4 % 56,847 4 % 55,706 5 % Fixed Income Products 54,097 4 % 36,414 3 % 37,911 3 % Mutual Funds 379,964 25 % 354,647 24 % 294,586 23 % Fee-Based Accounts 550,489 36 % 487,988 34 % 390,691 31 % Insurance and Annuity Products 219,878 14 % 233,878 16 % 228,888 18 % New Issue Sales Credits 69,204 5 % 94,005 6 % 66,938 5 % Total Private Client Group Commissions And Fees $ 1,520,337 100 % $ 1,451,899 100 % $ 1,262,751 100 % Net interest revenue in the Private Client Group is generated by customer balances , predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations less interest paid on customer cash balances . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding the Company ’ s net interest revenues . Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's account . 3 Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business .

The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . The Company has offices in Europe ( including , Turkey ) , Canada and Latin America . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally FINRA , the IIROC and other securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . 11 The Company 's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate SIPC fund levels , each of the Company 's domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2008 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . In December 2003 , RJA joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed Vermont insurance company , to provide excess SIPC coverage . CAPCO provides account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms with no aggregate limit . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s , however , this rating is currently under a negative credit watch . These coverages do not protect against market fluctuations . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions which are charged with the administration of securities laws . Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs , and the IIROC . RJ Ltd. is required by the IIROC to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF Board of Directors determines the fund size required to meet its coverage obligations and sets a quarterly assessment rate . Dealer members are assessed the lesser of 0.1875 % of revenue or a risk based assessment . RJ Ltd. paid CDN $ 91,000 in 2008 . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1.0 million per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1.0 million for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC , FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . The Company 's investment advisory operations , including the Company-sponsored mutual funds , are also subject to extensive regulation . The Company 's U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers , including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations . Possible sanctions that may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees , limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business for specified periods of time , the revocation of registrations , and other censures and fines . A regulatory proceeding , regardless of whether it results in a sanction , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on the reputation of an asset manager . The Company is a “ unitary savings and loan holding company , ” as defined by federal law , which owns one savings association , RJBank , and is under the supervision of , and subject to periodic examination by , the OTS . Since the Company was a savings and loan holding company prior to May 4 , 1999 , the Company is exempt from certain restrictions that would otherwise apply under federal law to the activities and investments of a savings and loan holding company . These restrictions would become applicable to the Company if RJBank fails to meet a qualified thrift lender test established by federal law . As of September 30 , 2008 , RJBank was in compliance with qualified thrift lender standards . RJBank is under the supervision of , and subject to periodic examination by , the OTS , and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OTS , the Federal Reserve Board , and the FDIC . In addition , since RJBank has FDIC insurance , it is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act . 12 RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJBank's financial statements . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJBank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . The Company recently announced its plans to seek financial holding company status as a result of RJBank ’ s planned conversion from a thrift to a nationally-chartered commercial bank . The Company ’ s plan includes an application to become a bank holding company , and then the election to become a financial holding company . Once the financial holding company status is achieved , the Company would be under regulation of the Federal Reserve . The Company 's federally chartered trust company is subject to regulation by the OCC . This regulation focuses on , among other things , ensuring the safety and soundness of the trust company ’ s provision of fiduciary services . As a public company whose common stock is listed on the NYSE , the Company is subject to corporate governance requirements established by the SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of the Board of Directors , the structure of its Audit Committee , and ethical standards for its senior financial officers . Under SEC and NYSE rules , the Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on its Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to complete an assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain a report from its independent auditors regarding their opinion of the Company's internal control over financial reporting . This requirement has imposed additional costs on the Company , reflecting internal staff and management time , as well as additional audit fees since the Act went into effect . 13 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Executive officers of the registrant ( which includes officers of certain significant subsidiaries ) who are not Directors of the registrant are as follows : Jennifer C.

Factors Affecting “ Forward-Looking Statements ” From time to time , the Company may publish “ forward-looking statements ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended , and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended , or make oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements . These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance , future revenues or earnings , business prospects , projected ventures , new products , anticipated market performance , and similar matters . The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements . In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor , the Company cautions readers that a variety of factors could cause the Company 's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company 's forward-looking statements . These risks and uncertainties , many of which are beyond the Company 's control , are discussed in Item 1A , “ Risk Factors ” in this report . The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS The Company ’ s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect its business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows , and the trading price of its common stock . 15 The Company is Affected by Difficult Conditions in the Global Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , the Company is affected by economic and political conditions . These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to the operating results of the company , including the inflation rate and the related impact on the securities markets , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , reduced investor confidence , a slowdown in economic activity , and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets . These conditions historically have reduced the Company ’ s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affected its profitability . Additionally , a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand . Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades the Company executes for its clients , a decline in the value of securities it holds in inventory as assets , and reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which the Company participates . In addition , declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios , in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations , and in the failure of the Company ’ s clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations . During market downturns , the Company ’ s counterparties may be less likely to complete transactions . Also , the Company permits its clients to purchase securities on margin . During periods of steep declines in securities prices , the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser ’ s indebtedness . If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans , the Company may lose money on these margin transactions . This may cause the Company to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults . Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year , with increasing foreclosures and unemployment , have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by other financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks . These write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities , in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases , to fail . Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties , many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit-worthy borrowers . These lender concerns are particularly severe with respect to financial institution borrowers . As described in Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” the resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect the Company ’ s financial condition and results of operations as well as its access to capital . Lack of Liquidity or Access to Capital Could Impair the Company ’ s Business and Financial Condition Liquidity , or ready access to funds , is essential to the Company ’ s business . A compromise to the Company ’ s liquidity could have a significant negative effect on the Company . Some potential conditions that could negatively affect the Company ’ s liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets , diminished access to debt or capital markets , unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments ( including , among others , risks associated with auction rate securities ) . The Company ’ s largest subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries . These subsidiaries require access to funds in order to maintain certain net capital requirements . If existing internal sources of liquidity resources do not satisfy the Company ’ s needs , it may have to seek outside financing or scale back or curtail its operations , including limiting its efforts to recruit additional Financial Advisors , selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to the Company , cutting or eliminating the dividends it pays to its shareholders and reducing its operating expenses . The availability of outside financing , including access to the capital markets and bank lending , depends on a variety of factors , such as market conditions , the general availability of credit , the volume of trading activities , the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and the Company ’ s credit ratings . The Company ’ s cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads . In addition , a reduction in the Company ’ s credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position , increase its borrowing costs , limit its access to the capital markets or trigger its obligations under certain financial agreements . As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically , many lenders have reduced , and in some cases , ceased to provide funding to borrowers , including the Company . As such , the Company may not be able to successfully obtain outside financing to fund its operations on favorable terms , or at all . See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources , ” for additional information on liquidity and how the Company manages its liquidity risk . 16 The Company is Exposed to Market Risk The Company , directly and indirectly , is affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company ’ s net interest spread – the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rate the Company pays for deposits and other sources of funding – which could in turn affect the Company ’ s net interest income and earnings . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with the Company ’ s operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , and derivatives . Market conditions that may shift from time to time , thereby exposing the Company to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s exposure to and approaches to managing market risk . The Company Is Exposed to Credit Risk The Company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money , securities or other assets will not perform their obligations . These parties may default in their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties who are indebted to the Company could result in losses . In addition , the credit quality of the Company ’ s loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings . Due to the growth in RJBank ’ s loan portfolio , credit risk at RJBank has become more significant . Continued declines in the housing market or a sustained economic downturn may cause the Company to have to write-down the value of some of the loans in RJBank ’ s ’ s portfolio . Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of the Company ’ s debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy , such as the U.S. is currently experiencing . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk . The Market Price of the Company ’ s Common Stock May Continue to be Volatile The market price of the Company ’ s common stock has been , and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to fluctuations . Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with the current economic downturn and may continue to experience such pressures in the future . Significant declines in the market price of the Company ’ s common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm its ability to recruit and retain key employees , reduce its access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm the Company ’ s business or financial condition . The Company ’ s Business Depends on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts By the Company ’ s Asset Management Subsidiaries A large portion of the Company ’ s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company ’ s revenues , business and financial condition . In addition , if these products experience losses , or increased investor redemptions , the Company may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services it provides on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities . The investment management fees the Company is paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition , renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new , lower-priced investment products and services . In addition , changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect the Company ’ s revenues , business and financial condition . Asset management fees often are comprised of base management and incentive fees . Management fees are primarily based on assets under management . If the Company experiences losses in its managed accounts , its fees will decline . In addition , the relative investment performance of these accounts could affect the Company ’ s ability to attract and retain clients and thus affect the Company ’ s revenues , business and financial condition . 17 The Company Faces Intense Competition The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses . The Company competes on the basis of a number of factors , including the quality of its Financial Advisors and associates , its products and services and location and reputation in local markets . Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of the Company ’ s competitors . Because of recent market unrest and increased government intervention , this trend toward consolidation has intensified . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company ’ s competitors . The Company ’ s ability to develop and retain its client base depends on the reputation , judgment , business generation capabilities and skills of its employees and Financial Advisors . As such , to compete effectively , the Company must attract , retain , and motivate qualified associates , including successful Financial Advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business and Financial Condition The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . The Company could be subject to civil liability , criminal liability , or sanctions , including revocation of its subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors , censures , fines , or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business , if it violates such laws or regulations . Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s business , financial condition and prospects . The Company ’ s banking operations also expose it to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws . In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and the economy , regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry , including by introducing proposals for new legislation . The Company is unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented and in what form , or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations , including the interpretation or implementation thereof , will occur in the future . Any such action could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on its business , financial condition and results of operations . The Company also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . See the section entitled “ Business – Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s regulatory environment and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding the Company ’ s approaches to managing regulatory risk . Legal actions brought against the Company may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other results adverse to the Company , which could materially adversely affect the Company ’ s business , financial condition or results of operation , or cause it serious reputational harm . In turbulent times such as these , the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased . These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions , issues related to the suitability of its investment advice based on the Company ’ s clients' investment objectives ( including auction rate securities ) , the ability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions , contractual issues , employment claims , and potential liability for other advice it provides to participants in strategic transactions . The Company has received inquiries from the SEC , the FINRA and several state regulatory authorities requesting information concerning auction rate securities . The Company has also been named in a civil class action lawsuit relating to sales of auction rate securities . The Company is working with other industry participants in order to resolve issues relating to auction rate securities and is exploring a range of potential solutions . If the Company were to determine , in order to resolve pending claims , inquiries or investigations , to repurchase at par value auction rate securities from certain of its clients , the Company would be required to assess whether it has sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to do so , and there can be no assurance that the Company would have such capacity . See Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings , ” of this report for a discussion of the Company ’ s legal matters ( including auction rate securities ) and Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding the Company ’ s approaches to managing legal risk . 18 The Company ’ s Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave it Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk The Company seeks to manage , monitor and control its operational , legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms , however , there can be no assurance that its procedures will be fully effective . Further , the Company ’ s risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . In addition , some of the Company ’ s risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets , clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate . In addition , RJBank has undergone significant growth in recent years . A failure to adequately manage the growth of RJBank , or to effectively manage the Company ’ s risk , could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition . The Company must also address potential conflicts of interest that arise in its business . The Company has procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest , but identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest can be complex and difficult and the Company ’ s reputation could be damaged if its fails , or appears to fail , to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest . For more information on how the Company monitors and manages market and certain other risks , see Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report . The Company Is Exposed to Operational Risk The Company ’ s diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems , or from external events . The Company ’ s business depends on its ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions . The Company ’ s financial , accounting , data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control , adversely affecting its ability to process these transactions or provide these services . Operational risk exists in every activity , function , or unit of the Company , and can take the form of internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , business disruption or system failures , and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . The Company also faces the risk of operational failure , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that it uses to facilitate its securities transactions . In recent years there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , which has increased the Company ’ s exposure to certain financial intermediaries the Company uses and could affect its ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in such events . Any such failure , termination or constraint could adversely affect the Company ’ s ability to effect transactions , service its clients and manage its exposure to risk . In addition , significant operational loss could damage the Company ’ s reputation . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk . 19 The Company ’ s Business Depends on Technology The Company ’ s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems . In addition to better serving clients , the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms to reduce costs . The Company ’ s continued success will depend , in part , upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of its systems , its ability to address the needs of its clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and its ability to retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of its systems , which could result from events beyond the Company ’ s control , or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to the Company ’ s reputation . The Company ’ s operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks . Although the Company takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant , the computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access , computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact . If one or more of these events occur , this could jeopardize the Company ’ s or its clients ’ or counterparties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the Company ’ s , its clients ’ , its counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations . The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures , to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications , and it may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or not fully covered through any insurance it maintains . See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s exposure to and approaches to managing this type of operational risk . The Company ’ s Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by New Regulations to Which It Expects to Become Subject as a Result of Becoming a Financial Holding Company In September 2008 , the Company announced that it will seek approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company . Although the Company has a statutory grace period of two years , with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of five years , to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies , and although it expects to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which it currently engages after such time , it is possible that certain of the Company ’ s existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations . In addition , as a financial holding company , the Company will become subject to the comprehensive , consolidated supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board , including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements , and , as a nationally-chartered commercial bank , RJBank will be subject to the functional supervision and regulation of the OCC . See the section entitled “ Business –Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information . The Company ’ s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions The Company ’ s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , the Company ’ s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications . For the past several years , the Company has been unable to obtain meaningful hurricane-related insurance coverage at a reasonable cost for its headquarters complex in St. Petersburg , Florida . Due to the modest hurricane activity during the past three seasons , such coverage has become more readily available and , effective May 15 , 2008 , the Company has increased its limits to levels management considers adequate for such a catastrophe . Notwithstanding this coverage , the Company ’ s business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex . The Company has also developed a business continuity plan for its Private Client Group branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather .

Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors .

See Item 7 , “ Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , ” in this report for financial information regarding the Company ’ s net interest revenues . Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and FINRA rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business .

REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company ’ s business . Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including : · sales methods · trading practices · uses and safekeeping of clients ' funds and securities · capital structure and financial soundness · record keeping · the conduct of directors , officers and employees · internal controls · insurance requirements 8 The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . The Company has offices in France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Switzerland , Belgium , Luxemburg , Turkey , British Virgin Islands , Canada and Latin America . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally FINRA , the IDA and other securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by government agencies ) for regulating the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . The Company 's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate SIPC fund levels , each of the Company 's domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2007 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . In December 2003 , RJA joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed Vermont insurance company , to provide excess SIPC coverage . CAPCO provides account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms with no aggregate limit . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s . These coverages do not protect against market fluctuations .

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements .

The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . Table of Contents ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS The Company ’ s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect its business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows , and the trading price of its common stock . Economic and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , the Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions , changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , investor confidence , and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets . Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce the Company ’ s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect its profitability . The Company Faces Intense Competition The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company ’ s competitors . Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . 10 Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . See the section entitled “ Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s regulatory environment and Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” , for a discussion of the Company ’ s legal matters . The Company could be subject to civil liability , criminal liability , or sanctions , including revocation of its subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors , censures , fines , or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business , if it violates such laws or regulations . Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s financial condition , results of operations , and business prospects . The Company ’ s banking operations also expose it to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws . In addition , the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years . The Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations , changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The Company ’ s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology The Company ’ s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems , and its continued success will depend upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of those systems , which could result from events beyond the Company ’ s control , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to the Company ’ s reputation . The Company Is Exposed to Market Risk The Company , directly and indirectly , is affected by changes in market conditions . Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions . For example , changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company ’ s net interest margin – the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rate the Company pays for deposits and other sources of funding – which could in turn affect the Company ’ s net interest income and earnings . Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with the Company ’ s operations and activities including loans , deposits , securities , short-term borrowings , long-term debt , trading account assets and liabilities , and derivatives . Market conditions that may shift from time to time , thereby exposing the Company to market risk , include fluctuations in interest rates , equity prices , and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer . The Company Is Exposed to Credit Risk The credit quality of the Company ’ s loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings . Credit risk is the risk of loss from a debtor ’ s inability to meet financial obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms . Risks associated with credit quality include adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of the Company ’ s debtors that could affect the debtors ’ repayment of outstanding obligations , and that the strength of the U.S. economy may be different than expected resulting in deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit . The Company Is Exposed to Operational Risk The Company ’ s diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems , or from external events . Operational risk exists in every activity , function , or unit of the Company , and includes : internal or external fraud , employment and hiring practices , an error in meeting a professional obligation , business disruption or system failures , and failed transaction processing . Also , increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors , including outsourced operations . Damage to the Company ’ s reputation could also result from a significant operational loss . The Company ’ s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious WeatherConditions The Company ’ s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . During 2004 and 2005 , there was a significant increase in hurricane activity on the Gulf Coast which directly affected other parts of Florida . While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , the Company ’ s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications . In addition , as a result of high levels of storm induced damage during these years in Florida and along the Gulf Coast , insurance coverage for wind and flood damage has become harder to obtain and substantially more expensive . As a consequence , the Company has been forced to pay more for the limited coverage it obtained and self-insure against these risks to a greater degree than in the past . The Company ’ s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts By Our Asset Management Subsidiaries A large portion of the Company ’ s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company ’ s revenues and profits . Further , changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts could affect the Company ’ s revenues and profits . 11 Insurance Risks The Company ’ s operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to its use of a combination of insurance , self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks , including , without limitation , property and casualty , workers ’ compensation , general liability , and the Company-funded portion of employee-related health care benefits . Other Risks See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding the Company ’ s exposure to , and approaches to managing , market risk , interest rate risk , equity price risk , credit risk , operational risk and regulatory and legal risk .

Financial information concerning RJF for each of the fiscal years ended September 30 , 2006 , September 30 , 2005 and September 24 , 2004 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto .

PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP The Company provides securities transaction and financial planning services to approximately 1.5 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJA , RJFS , RJ Ltd. , and Raymond James Investment Services Limited ( “ RJIS '' ) , an independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom . The Company 's Financial Advisors offer a broad range of investments and services , including both third party and proprietary products , and a range of financial planning services . In most cases , the Company charges commissions for sales of investment products to its Private Client Group clients based on an established commission schedule . Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . An increasing number of clients are electing asset-based fee alternatives instead of the traditional commission structure ; in fiscal year 2006 asset-based fees from such accounts represented 31 % of the Private Client Group 's commission and fees . The majority of the Company ’ s U.S. Financial Advisors are also licensed to sell insurance and annuity products through its general insurance agency , Planning Corporation of America ( “ PCA ” ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of RJA .

James National Training Center in St. Petersburg , Florida . Raymond James Financial Services RJFS supports 3,255 independent contractor Financial Advisors in providing products and services to their Private Client Group clients in 1,426 offices and 539 satellite offices throughout all 50 states . The number of Financial Advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 13 . Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees . They are permitted to conduct other businesses unrelated to their RJFS activities such as offering fixed insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services , among others . Through its Financial Institutions Division ( “ FID ” ) , RJFS offers securities to customers of financial institutions such as banks , thrifts and credit unions .

Raymond James Investment Services Limited The Company is a 75 % shareholder of RJIS . This entity operates an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom , and currently has 36 branch locations and 71 Financial Advisors . 3 RJA - Operations RJA's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders , processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements and general office administration for most of the Company's securities brokerage operations . At September 30 , 2006 , RJA employed 721 persons in its operations areas who provide services primarily to the Private Client Group , but also support the Company 's other segments . The Company 's businesses are supported by , and are dependent upon , an extensive system of electronic data processing . These computer systems are largely developed and maintained by the 726 employees in the Company ’ s information technology department , most of whom are located in St. Petersburg . The Company 's operations were not adversely affected by the series of hurricanes that Florida experienced during 2005 . However , the Company continues to enhance certain aspects of its business continuity plan to deal with the possible impact of future hurricanes or other events by expanding its operational and processing capabilities in Michigan . The Company has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to permit continued operation of critical business functions in the event of disruptions to the St. Petersburg facility ; all mission critical business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and the Company has a staff which devotes their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . In that connection , the Company maintains computer capacity to support mission critical functions at its Michigan location , and conducts some of its daily operational activities from that site . Systems have been designed so that the Company can transfer all mission critical processing activities to Michigan , and personnel have been identified who are assigned responsibility for this role , including some personnel who will be required to temporarily relocate to Michigan to carry out these activities if necessary . Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets activities primarily consist of equity and fixed income products and services . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . 4 Institutional Sales Institutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment 's revenue , which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and promote those opportunities . The Company 's institutional clients are serviced by the RJA and RJ Ltd. Institutional Equity Departments , the RJA Fixed Income Department , the European offices of RJFS , and Raymond James Financial International Ltd , an institutional UK broker-dealer located in London . In providing securities brokerage services to its institutional clients , the Company charges its commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved . Capital Markets Commissions For the Fiscal Years Ended : Sept. 30 , % of Sept. 30 , % of Sept. 24 , % of 2006 Total 2005 Total 2004 Total ( $ in 000 's ) Equity $ 217,840 84 % $ 193,001 74 % $ 174,464 69 % Fixed Income 41,830 16 % 66,431 26 % 77,102 31 % Total commissions $ 259,670 100 % $ 259,432 100 % $ 251,566 100 % The 109 domestic and overseas professionals in RJA 's Institutional Equity Sales and Sales Trading Departments maintain relationships with over 1,310 institutional clients , principally in North America and Europe .

Equity Research Department The 47 domestic senior analysts in RJA 's research department support the Company's institutional and retail sales efforts and publish research on approximately 670 companies .

Equity Trading Trading equity securities in the over-the-counter ( `` OTC '' ) market involves the purchase of securities from , and the sale of securities to , clients of the Company or other dealers who may be purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting as agent for their clients . Profits and losses are derived from the spreads between bid and asked prices , as well as market trends for the individual securities during the holding period .

In addition to RJA 's managed and co-managed offerings , this department coordinates the firm 's syndicate and selling group activities in transactions managed by other investment banking firms .

The 28 taxable and 22 tax-exempt RJA fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate ( including high yield ) , municipal , government , government agency , and mortgage-backed bonds , asset backed securities , preferred stock and certificates of deposit from/to clients of the Company or other dealers who may be purchasing or selling securities for their own account or acting as an agent for their clients . RJA enters into future commitments such as forward contracts and “ to be announced ” securities ( e.g . securities having a stated coupon and original term to maturity , although the issuer and/or the specific pool of mortgage loans is not known at the time of the transaction ) . In addition , a subsidiary of RJF participates in the interest rate swaps market as a principal , both for economically hedging RJA fixed income inventory and in transactions with customers .

OTHER This segment includes various investment and corporate activities of Raymond James Financial , Inc. 8 COMPETITION The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses . The Company competes with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , some of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . The Company also competes with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . The Company competes principally on the basis of quality of its associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . The Company 's ability to compete effectively in its businesses is substantially dependent on its continuing ability to attract , retain , and motivate qualified associates , including successful Financial Advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company ’ s business . Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including : · sales methods · trading practices · uses and safekeeping of clients ' funds and securities · capital structure and financial soundness · record keeping · the conduct of directors , officers and employees · internal controls · insurance requirements The financial services industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Various Company affiliates have offices in France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Switzerland , Belgium , Luxemburg , Turkey , Argentina , India , British Virgin Islands , Canada and Uruguay . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the U.S. and Canada , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally the NASD , the NYSE and other securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by the SEC ) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . 9 The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . The Company 's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate fund levels , each of the Company 's domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2006 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . In December 2003 , RJA joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed Vermont insurance company , to provide excess SIPC coverage . CAPCO provides account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms with no aggregate limit . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s . These coverages do not protect against market fluctuations . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in 13 provinces and territorial jurisdictions and are charged with the administration of securities laws . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all Canadian jurisdictions . Securities dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs , the IDA and Market Regulation Services Inc. RJ Ltd. is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF may charge member firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums based on capital deficiencies . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1,000,000 per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1,000,000 for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . The Company 's investment advisory operations , including the Company-sponsored mutual funds , are also subject to extensive regulation . The Company 's U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers , including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations . Possible sanctions that may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees , limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business for specified periods of time , the revocation of registrations , and other censures and fines . A regulatory proceeding , regardless of whether it results in a sanction , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on the reputation of an asset manager . RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJBank's financial statements . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJBank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . The Company 's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation by the states in which they are chartered . These regulations focus on , among other things , the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust companies . 10 As a public company , the Company is subject to corporate governance requirements established by SEC and NYSE , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of the Board of Directors , the structure of its Audit Committee , and ethical standards for its senior financial officers , among other things . Under SEC and NYSE rules , the Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on its Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to complete an assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain reports from its independent auditors regarding their opinion of management's assessment of internal controls and their independent opinion regarding the Company 's internal control over financial reporting . This requirement imposes additional costs on the Company , reflecting internal staff and management time , as well as additional audit fees and fees for outside service providers and consultants since the Act went into effect .

The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements . Table of Contents ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS Economic and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , the Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions , changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , investor confidence , and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets . Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce the Company ’ s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect its profitability . The Company Faces Intense Competition The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company ’ s competitors . Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . 11 Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . See the section entitled “ Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s regulatory environment and Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” , for a discussion of the Company ’ s legal matters . The Company could be subject to civil liability , criminal liability , or sanctions , including revocation of its subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors , censures , fines , or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business , if it violates such laws or regulations . Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s financial condition , results of operations , and business prospects . In addition , the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years . The Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations , changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The Company ’ s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology The Company ’ s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems , and its continued success will depend upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain skilled information technology employees . Failure of those systems , which could result from events beyond the Company ’ s control , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to the Company ’ s reputation . The Company ’ s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions The Company ’ s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . During 2004 and 2005 , there was a significant increase in hurricane activity on the Gulf Coast which has directly affected other parts of Florida . While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield , Michigan location ( see Item 1 , “ Business ” in this report ) , the Company ’ s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications . In addition , as a result of high levels of storm induced damage during these years in Florida and along the Gulf Coast , insurance coverage for wind and flood damage has become harder to obtain and substantially more expensive . As a consequence , the Company has been forced to pay more for the limited coverage it obtained and self-insure against these risks to a greater degree than in the past . The Company ’ s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products A large portion of the Company ’ s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company ’ s revenues and profits . Other Risks See Item 7A , “ Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ” in this report regarding the Company ’ s exposure to , and approaches to managing , market risk , interest rate risk , equity price risk , credit risk , operational risk and regulatory and legal risk .

Varying discounts may be given , generally based upon the client 's level of business , the trade size , service level provided , and other relevant factors . An increasing number of clients are electing asset-based fee alternatives instead of the traditional commission structure ; in fiscal year 2005 asset-based fees from such accounts represented 27 % of the Private Client Group 's commission and fees .

Raymond James & Associates RJA employs 951 Financial Advisors in 131 retail branch offices concentrated in the Southern , Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States . RJA 's Financial Advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staffs . The number of Financial Advisors per office ranges from one to 32 . Raymond James Financial Services RJFS supports 3,464 independent contractor Financial Advisors in providing products and services to their Private Client Group clients in 1,514 offices and 586 satellite offices throughout all 50 states . The number of Financial Advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 30 . Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees . They are permitted to conduct other businesses unrelated to their RJFS activities such as offering fixed insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , and accounting and tax services , among others . Through its Financial Institutions Division , RJFS offers securities to customers of financial institutions such as banks , thrifts and credit unions and has 500 Financial Advisors in 419 locations . RJFS also provides custodial , trading and other support services to unaffiliated independent investment advisors through its Investment Advisor Division . Raymond James Ltd. RJ Ltd. is a self-clearing broker-dealer with its own operations and information processing personnel . RJ Ltd. has 54 private client branches with 175 employee Financial Advisors and 104 independent contractor Financial Advisors , all located in Canada . 3 Raymond James Investment Services Limited The Company is a 75 % shareholder of RJIS . This entity operates an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom , and currently has 31 branch locations and 65 Financial Advisors . RJA - Operations RJA's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders , processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements , internal financial accounting and controls and general office administration for most of the Company 's securities brokerage operations . At September 30 , 2005 , RJA employed 806 persons in its operations areas who provide services primarily to the Private Client Group , but also support the Company 's other segments . The Company 's businesses are supported by , and are dependent upon , an extensive system of electronic data processing . These computer systems are largely developed and maintained by the 725 employees in the Company ’ s information technology department , most of whom are located in St. Petersburg . The Company has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to permit continued operation of critical business functions in the event of disruptions to the St. Petersburg facility ; all mission critical business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and the Company has a staff who devote their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . In that connection , the Company maintains redundant computer capacity supporting mission critical functions at its Michigan location , and conducts some of its daily operational activities from that site . Systems have been designed so that the Company can transfer all mission critical processing activities to Michigan , and personnel have been identified who are assigned responsibility for this role , including some personnel who will be required for a limited period of time to relocate to Michigan to carry out these activities if necessary . The Company 's operations were not adversely affected by the series of hurricanes that Florida experienced during 2005 . However , the Company continues to enhance certain aspects of its business continuity plan to deal with the possible impact of future hurricanes by expanding its operational and processing capabilities in Michigan . Present plans are to complete this process over the next two years . Clients' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the size of the loan balance in the client's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances ; to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets activities primarily consist of equity and fixed income products and services . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business . 4 Institutional Sales Institutional sales commissions account for a significant portion of this segment 's revenue , which is fueled by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group ’ s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and promote those opportunities . The Company 's institutional clients are serviced by the RJA and RJ Ltd. Institutional Equity Departments , the RJA Fixed Income Department , the European offices of RJFS , and Raymond James Financial International Ltd , an institutional UK broker-dealer located in London . In providing securities brokerage services to its institutional clients , the Company charges its commissions on equity transactions based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution . Fixed income commissions are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved . Capital Markets Commissions For the Fiscal Years Ended : Sept. 30 , % of Sept. 24 , % of Sept. 26 , % of 2005 Total 2004 Total 2003 Total ( $ in 000 's ) Equity $ 193,001 74 % $ 173,594 69 % $ 95,926 48 % Fixed Income 66,431 26 % 77,972 31 % 102,832 52 % Total commissions $ 259,432 100 % $ 251,566 100 % $ 198,758 100 % The 92 domestic and overseas professionals in RJA 's Institutional Equity Sales and Sales Trading Departments maintain relationships with over 1,800 institutional clients , principally in North America and Europe . In addition to the Company's headquarters in St. Petersburg , FL , RJA has institutional equity sales offices in New York City , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , London and Geneva . RJ Ltd. has 28 institutional equity sales and trading professionals servicing predominantly Canadian institutional investors from offices in Montreal , Toronto and Vancouver .

The Company competes with many larger , better capitalized providers of financial services , including other securities firms , some of which are affiliated with major financial services companies , insurance companies , banking institutions and other organizations . The Company also competes with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . The Company competes principally on the basis of quality of its associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . The Company 's ability to compete effectively in its businesses is substantially dependent on its continuing ability to attract , retain , and motivate qualified associates , including successful Financial Advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company ’ s business . The financial services industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Various Company affiliates have offices in France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Switzerland , Belgium , Luxemburg , Turkey , Argentina , India , British Virgin Islands , Canada and Uruguay . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SROs '' ) , principally the NASD , the NYSE and other securities exchanges . These SROs adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by the SEC ) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in 13 provinces and territorial jurisdictions and are charged with the administration of securities laws . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all Canadian jurisdictions . Securities dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the Securities Commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SROs , the IDA and Market Regulation Services Inc. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including : · sales methods · trading practices · uses and safekeeping of clients ' funds and securities · capital structure and financial soundness · record keeping · the conduct of directors , officers and employees · internal controls · insurance requirements 9 The SEC , SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . The Company 's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate fund levels , each of the Company 's two domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2005 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . In December 2003 , RJA joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed Vermont insurance company , to provide excess SIPC coverage . CAPCO provides account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms with no aggregate limit . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s . These coverages do not protect against market fluctuations . RJ Ltd. is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF may charge member firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums based on capital deficiencies . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1,000,000 per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1,000,000 for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . The Company 's investment advisory operations , including the Company-sponsored mutual funds , are also subject to extensive regulation . The Company 's U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers , including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations . Possible sanctions that may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees , limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business for specified periods of time , the revocation of registrations , and other censures and fines . A regulatory proceeding , regardless of whether it results in a sanction , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on the reputation of an asset manager . RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJBank's financial statements . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJBank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . The Company 's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation by the states in which they are chartered . These regulations focus on , among other things , the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust companies . As a public company , the Company is subject to corporate governance requirements established by SEC and New York Stock Exchange , as well as federal and state law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of the Board of Directors , the structure of its Audit Committee , and ethical standards for its senior financial officers , among other things . Under SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules , the Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on its Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . 10 Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to complete an assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting and to obtain reports from its independent auditors regarding their opinion of management's assessment of internal controls and their independent opinion regarding the Company 's internal control over financial reporting . This requirement imposes additional costs on the Company , reflecting internal staff and management time , as well as additional audit fees and fees for outside service providers and consultants . On September 27 , 2005 , the State of Utah filed a petition for Order of Censure , Suspension of License and Imposition of Fine against the Company related to the alleged failure to supervise a former Financial Advisor . The Utah Securities Division asked the Division Director to enter an order censuring the Company , suspending its license in Utah for 30 days , ordering a fine of $ 100,000 and requiring the engagement of an independent consultant to review its supervisory structure and procedures . The Company is contesting these allegations . As previously reported , on September 30 , 2004 the SEC instituted an administrative proceeding against RJFS alleging fraud and failure to supervise a former Financial Advisor in the RJFS Cranston , Rhode Island office . The Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision in September 2005 finding that RJFS failed to supervise and that it was liable for the fraud committed by its former Financial Advisor , and ordered RJFS to disgorge $ 5,866 and pay a civil penalty of $ 6.9 million . The Judge denied the SEC ’ s request for a cease and desist order , a consultant review and a finding that RJFS violated e-mail retention rules . The decision was confirmed by the SEC on November 21 , 2005 . RISK FACTORS Economic and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses . As such , the Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions , changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets , fluctuations in interest and currency rates , investor confidence , and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets . Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce the Company ’ s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect its profitability . The Company Faces Intense Competition The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses . See the section entitled “ Competition ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company ’ s competitors . Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business , results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company ’ s Business The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business . See the section entitled “ Regulation ” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company ’ s regulatory environment and Item 3 , “ Legal Proceedings ” , for a discussion of the Company ’ s legal matters . The Company could be subject to civil liability , criminal liability , or sanctions , including revocation of its subsidiaries ’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers , revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors , censures , fines , or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business , if it violates such laws or regulations . Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company ’ s financial condition , results of operations , and business prospects . In addition , the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years . The Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations , changes in federal , state or foreign tax laws , or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations . The Company ’ s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology The Company ’ s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems , and its continued success will depend upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain skilled employees . Failure of those systems , which could result from events beyond the Company ’ s control , could result in financial losses , liability to clients and damage to the Company ’ s reputation . 11 The Company ’ s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions The Company ’ s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg , Florida . During the past two years , there has been a significant increase in hurricane activity in the Gulf Coast which has directly affected other parts of Florida . While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield , Michigan location ( see section entitled “ RJA - Operations ” above ) , the Company ’ s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications . The Company ’ s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products A large portion of the Company ’ s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities . Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company ’ s revenues and profits .

RJ Ltd. has 43 private client branches with 183 employee Financial Advisors and 76 independent Financial Advisors , all located in Canada . 3 Raymond James Investment Services Limited The Company is a 75 % shareholder of Raymond James Investment Services Limited . This entity operates an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom , and currently has 32 branch locations and 60 Financial Advisors . RJA - Operations RJA 's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders , processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements , internal financial accounting and controls and general office administration for most of the Company 's securities brokerage operations . At September 24 , 2004 , RJA employed 834 persons in its operations areas who provide services primarily to the Private Client Group , but also support the Company 's other segments . The Company 's businesses are supported by , and are dependent upon , an extensive system of electronic data processing . These computer systems are largely developed and maintained by the 658 employees in the Company ’ s information technology department , most of whom are located in St. Petersburg . The Company has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to permit continued operation of business critical functions in the event of disruptions to the St. Petersburg facility ; all mission critical business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and the Company has a staff who devote their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . In that connection , the Company maintains redundant computer capacity at its Detroit location , and conducts some of its daily operational activities from that site . Systems have been designed so that the Company can transfer all mission critical processing activities to Detroit , and personnel have been identified who are assigned responsibility for this role , including some personnel who will be required for a limited period of time to relocate to Detroit to carry out these activities if necessary . The Company 's operations were not adversely affected by the series of hurricanes that Florida experienced during the 2004 season . However , the Company did implement certain aspects of its business continuity plan to deal with the possible impact of these hurricanes . Based on this experience , the Company plans to enhance its business continuity plan to provide for a significant expansion of its operational and processing capabilities in Detroit . This process will be implemented over several years . Clients ' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan depends on the average loan balance in the client 's account . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances , and to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . 4 CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets activities primarily consist of equity and fixed income products and services .

The Company also competes with a number of firms offering on-line financial services and discount brokerage services , usually with lower levels of service , to individual clients . The Company competes principally on the basis of quality of associates , service , product selection , location and reputation in local markets . In the financial services industry , there is significant competition for qualified associates . The Company 's ability to compete effectively in its businesses is substantially dependent on its continuing ability to attract , retain , and motivate qualified associates , including successful Financial Advisors , investment bankers , trading professionals , portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel . REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company ’ s business . The financial services industry in the United States of America is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . RJA , RJFS and certain joint ventures in which the Company is a participant , have offices in France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Switzerland , Belgium , Luxemburg , Turkey , Argentina , India and Uruguay . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SRO 's '' ) , principally the NASD , the NYSE and other securities exchanges . These SRO 's adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by the SEC ) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . 9 The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities Commissions have been established in 13 provinces and territorial jurisdictions and are charged with the administration of securities laws . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all Canadian jurisdictions . Securities dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SRO 's which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the Securities Commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SRO 's , the Investment Dealers Association ( `` IDA '' ) and Market Regulation Services Inc. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including : · sales methods · trading practices · uses and safekeeping of clients ' funds and securities · capital structure and financial soundness of securities firms · record keeping · the conduct of directors , officers and employees · internal controls · insurance requirements The SEC , SRO 's and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . The Company 's U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate fund levels , each of the Company 's two domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay only the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2004 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . In December 2003 , RJA joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed New York insurance company , to continue to provide excess SIPC coverage . CAPCO provides account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s . RJ Ltd. is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF may charge member firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums based on capital deficiencies . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1,000,000 per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1,000,000 for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . The Company 's investment advisory operations , including the Company-sponsored mutual funds , are also subject to extensive regulation . The Company 's U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers , including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations . Possible sanctions that may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees , limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business for specified periods of time , the revocation of registrations , and other censures and fines . A regulatory proceeding , regardless of whether it results in a sanction , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on the reputation of an asset manager . 10 RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJBank 's financial statements . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJBank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . The Company 's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation by the states in which they are chartered . These regulations focus on , among other things , the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust companies . As a public company , the Company is subject to corporate governance requirements established by SEC and New York Stock Exchange , as well as Federal and State law . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company is required to meet certain requirements regarding business dealings with members of the Board of Directors , the structure of its Audit Committee , and ethical standards for its senior financial officers , among other things . Under SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules , the Company is required to comply with other standards of corporate governance , including having a majority of independent directors serve on its Board of Directors , and the establishment of independent audit , compensation and corporate governance committees . Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the Company will be required to complete an assessment of its internal controls for fiscal 2005 and will be required to obtain reports from its independent auditors regarding their view of management 's assessment of internal controls and their opinion regarding the Company 's internal controls . To comply with this requirement the Company will incur additional costs , including internal staff and management time , as well as additional audit fees and fees for outside service providers and consultants . As previously reported , RJFS and the SEC staff were unable to reach a resolution regarding a proposed enforcement action alleging fraud and failure to supervise a former Financial Advisor in the RJFS Rhode Island office . On September 30 , 2004 , the SEC issued an order instituting public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 , sections 15 ( b ) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , and section 203 ( f ) of the Investment advisor Act of 1940 against RJFS , its former President and a former branch manager . The Company has made provision in its financial statements for its estimate of the reasonable potential exposure for this claim ; the matter is scheduled for a hearing before an administrative law judge in February 2005 . As disclosed in the previous year 's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , the Company undertook a review of sales of Class A load mutual funds in excess of $ 2,500 since January 1 , 1999 and has refunded to clients any identified overcharges plus applicable interest arising from the failure to afford applicable discounts to clients . The refunds , including interest , aggregated $ 10,211,000 . Of the total refunds , the Company has estimated that it will recover $ 5,369,000 from its Financial Advisors ( of which $ 4,427,000 has already been collected ) and $ 774,000 from mutual fund companies . The Company had made adequate provisions in its fiscal 2003 consolidated financial statements reflecting the net impact of these refunds . In addition , RJFS paid fines aggregating $ 2,595,000 to the SEC and the NASD relating to this matter . 11 OTHER INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE BY THE COMPANY The Company 's internet address is www.raymondjames.com .

The number of Financial Advisors in RJFS offices ranges from one to 21 . The independent contractor Financial Advisors offer individual securities and investment advice primarily to individual investors . Independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and , accordingly , are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees . As independent contractors they are permitted to conduct other businesses such as offering fixed insurance products , independent registered investment advisory services , accounting and tax services , among others . These activities are required to be disclosed to and approved by RJFS . RJFS operates through several domestic sales divisions .

Raymond James Ltd. RJ Ltd. is a self-clearing broker-dealer with its own operations and information processing personnel . RJ Ltd. recently launched an independent contractor operation in Canada . RJ Ltd. has 32 private client branches with 181 employee Financial Advisors and 31 independent Financial Advisors , all located in Canada . Raymond James Investment Services Limited The Company is a 75 % shareholder of Raymond James Investment Services Limited . Thisentity introduced an independent contractor network in the United Kingdom , and currently has 25 branch locations and 53 Financial Advisors . RJA - Operations RJA 's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders , processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements , internal financial accounting and controls and general office administration for most of the Company 's securities brokerage operations . At September 26 , 2003 , RJA employed 938 persons in its operations areas . Operations personnel provide services primarily to the Private Client Group , but also supports the Company 's other segments . The Company 's businesses are supported by , and are dependent upon , an extensive system of electronic data processing . These computer systems are largely developed and maintained by the 655 employees in the Company ’ s information technology department , most of whom are located in St. Petersburg . The Company has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to permit continued operation of business critical functions in the event of disruptions to the St. Petersburg facility ; all mission critical business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions , and the Company has a staff who devote their full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans . In that connection , the Company maintains redundant computer capacity at its Detroit location , and conducts some of its daily data processing activity from that site . Systems have been designed so that the Company can transfer all mission critical processing activities to Detroit , and personnel have been identified who are assigned responsibility for this role , including some personnel who will be required to relocate to Detroit to carry out these activities if necessary . The Company conducts regular tests of its business continuity plan , and conducted a full data processing test in July 2003 and a subsequent data processing test in November 2003 . Based on the results of these on-going tests , the Company reviews and refines its systems and planning . Clients ' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan depends on the average loan balance in the client 's account and ranges from prime plus 1 % to prime minus .75 % . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . RJA 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) , which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( “ SEC ” ) and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances , and to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities . CAPITAL MARKETS Capital Markets activities primarily consist of equity and fixed income products and services . No single client accounts for a material percentage of this segment 's total business .

REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company ’ s business . The financial services industry in the United States of America is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . RJA , RJFS and certain joint ventures in which the Company is a participant , have offices in France , the United Kingdom , Germany , Switzerland , Belgium , Luxemburg , Turkey , Argentina , India and Uruguay . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SRO 's '' ) , principally the NASD , the NYSE and other securities exchanges . These SRO 's adopt and amend rules ( which are subject to approval by the SEC ) for governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers . The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws . Securities commissions have been established in 13 provinces and territorial jurisdictions and are charged with the administration of securities laws . RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all Canadian jurisdictions . Securities dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SRO 's which are responsible for the enforcement of and conformity with securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members . RJ Ltd. is regulated by the Securities Commissions in the jurisdictions of registration as well as by the SRO 's , the IDA and Market Regulation Services Inc. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including : — sales methods ; — trading practices ; — uses and safekeeping of clients funds and securities ; — capital structure and financial soundness of securities firms ; — record keeping ; — the conduct of directors , officers and employees ; — internal controls ; and — insurance requirements One of the primary purposes of these regulations is to enhance the protection of customer assets . Under certain circumstances , these rules may limit the ability of the Company to make capital withdrawals from its broker-dealer subsidiaries . The SEC , SRO 's and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure , fine , suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer , its officers or employees . Such administrative proceedings , whether or not resulting in adverse findings , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a broker-dealer . The Company 's clearing broker-dealer subsidiary , RJA , is required by federal law to belong to SIPC . When the SIPC fund falls below a certain amount , members are required to pay annual assessments of up to 1 % of adjusted gross revenues . As a result of adequate fund levels , each of the Company 's two domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries was required to pay the minimum annual assessment of $ 150 in fiscal 2003 . The SIPC fund provides protection for securities held in customer accounts up to $ 500,000 per customer , with a limitation of $ 100,000 on claims for cash balances . RJA currently carries an excess policy that provides additional protection for securities of up to $ 99,500,000 per customer , including another $ 900,000 for cash awaiting investment ; however , the carriers for this policy have advised the Company that it will no longer provide this coverage for the Company or any other securities brokerage firm , and RJA 's coverage will expire on February 16 , 2004 . The Company has joined with other major U.S. securities brokerage firms to form Customer Asset Protection Company ( “ CAPCO ” ) , a licensed New York insurance company , to continue providing this coverage . CAPCO intends to provide account protection for the total net equity of client accounts of participating firms . CAPCO has received a financial strength rating of A+ from Standard and Poor ’ s . RJ Ltd. is required by the IDA to belong to the Canadian Investors Protection Fund ( `` CIPF '' ) , whose primary role is investor protection . The CIPF may charge member firms assessments based on revenues and risk premiums based on capital deficiencies . The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to CDN $ 1,000,000 per client with separate coverage of CDN $ 1,000,000 for certain types of accounts . This coverage does not protect against market fluctuations . See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SEC and IDA regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements . The Company 's investment advisory operations , including the Company-sponsored mutual funds , are also subject to extensive regulation . The Company 's U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and are also required to make notice filings in certain states . Virtually all aspects of the asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations . These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers , including the power to limit or restrict an investment advisor from conducting its asset management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations . Possible sanctions that may be imposed for a failure include the suspension of individual employees , limitations on the asset managers engaging in the asset management business for specified periods of time , the revocation of registrations , and other censures and fines . A regulatory proceeding , regardless of whether it results in a sanction , can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on the reputation of an asset manager . RJBank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that , if undertaken , could have a direct material effect on RJBank 's financial statements . Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank 's assets , liabilities , and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices . RJBank 's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components , risk weightings , and other factors . Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ( as defined in the regulations ) . See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and capital analysis . The Company 's two state-chartered trust companies are subject to regulation by the states in which they are chartered . These regulations focus on , among other things , the soundness of internal controls in place at the trust companies . The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , which represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance , accounting obligations and corporate reporting . In particular , the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes : ( i ) new requirements for audit committees , including independence , expertise , and responsibilities ; ( ii ) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company ; ( iii ) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits ; ( iv ) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for public companies and their directors and executive officers ; and ( v ) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws . Although there have been and will continue to be additional expenses incurred in complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations , management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition . As a result of widespread publicity regarding alleged conflicts of interest and lack of objectivity in the activities of research departments of broker-dealer firms , major changes have been mandated by the SEC , NYSE and NASD in the rules regarding compensation of analysts , content of research reports and relationships of the research department to other activities such as corporate finance and investment banking . The SEC is considering a further evaluation of this area and may propose additional changes that could substantially affect the conduct and activities of research departments . The Company believes that it is in compliance with all existing rules . However , the application of these rules and further changes that may be imposed by regulators could adversely affect the effectiveness and value of research activities at broker-dealers . In March 2003 , the staff of the SEC , NASD and NYSE issued a joint report , which concluded , based on an “ examination sweep ” of a sample of broker-dealers , that many securities firms failed to provide breakpoint discounts in certain instances where customers were eligible to receive them . Following that report , the NASD required certain member firms , including RJA and RJFS , to conduct a self-assessment of break point compliance and report the results to the NASD by May 15 , 2003 . The regulators required member firms to reimburse , with interest , any customers identified in the self-assessment process that did not receive appropriate breakpoint discounts and to establish reserves for other customers who may make claims for reimbursement . Based on the reported results of the self-assessment , RJA and RJFS , along with approximately 175 other member firms that had similar results , have been advised by the NASD that they are required to expand their review to include all sales of Class A load mutual fund shares since January 1 , 2001 , and to refund to customers any overcharge arising from the failure to afford applicable discounts . The Company had determined to undertake such a review prior to receiving the additional notification from the NASD . As part of the notification from the NASD , RJA and RJFS have also been directed to send notice , by January 15 , 2004 , to all customers who made purchases of Class A load mutual fund shares since January 1 , 1999 that they may be entitled to similar refunds . At September 26 , 2003 , the Company estimated an amount due to customers for breakpoint discounts of $ 6,875,000 . Taking into consideration the amount the Company expects to recover from its Financial Advisors , the net pre-tax impact to the Company is $ 3,266,000 . RJA and RJFS , and a number of other firms , have also been advised by staff of the SEC and the NASD that they have preliminarily determined to recommend an enforcement action against them arising from the failure to afford appropriate discounts to customers in connection with these mutual fund transactions . The Company intends to review this matter with the SEC and NASD staffs as soon as practicable . While the Company is unable to predict at this time the outcome of these discussions , the resolution of these matters could result in a penalty that could be as much as $ 6.5 million .

Raymond James Ltd. - Retail RJ Ltd. has 21 retail branches and 237 Financial Advisors , all located in Canada . RJ Ltd. provides a broad range of financial products and services to clients , primarily in accordance with an established commission schedule .

Raymond James Investment Services Limited The Company owns 60 % of a joint venture known as Raymond James Investment Services Limited .

RJA - Operations RJA 's operations personnel are responsible for the execution of orders , processing of securities transactions , custody of client securities , receipt , identification and delivery of funds and securities , compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements , internal financial accounting and controls and general office administration for most of the Company 's securities brokerage operations . At September 27 , 2002 , RJA employed 616 persons in its operations areas . Operations personnel provide services primarily to the Company 's retail , capital markets and asset management business . The Company 's operations are supported by , and are dependent upon an extensive system of electronic data processing . The Company 's computer systems are largely developed and maintained by its internal staff of 634 associates , most of whom are located in St. Petersburg . Clients ' transactions in securities are effected on either a cash or margin basis . In margin transactions , the client pays a portion of the purchase price , and RJA makes a loan to the client for the balance , collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client . Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed to finance margin transactions . The financing of margin purchases is an important source of revenue to RJA , since the interest rate paid by the client on funds loaned by RJA exceeds RJA 's cost of short-term funds . The interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan depends on the average loan balance in the client 's account and ranges from prime plus 1 % to prime minus .75 % . Typically , broker-dealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients ' margin account borrowings . The Company 's primary source of funds to finance clients ' margin account balances has been cash balances in clients ' accounts ( Client Interest Program ) which are funds awaiting investment . In addition , pursuant to written agreements with clients , broker-dealers are permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission ( `` SEC '' ) and NYSE rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions . SEC regulations , however , restrict the use of clients ' funds derived from pledging and lending clients ' securities , as well as funds awaiting investment , to the financing of margin account balances , and to the extent not so used , such funds are required to be deposited in a special account for the benefit of clients . The regulations also require broker-dealers , within designated periods of time , to obtain possession or control of , and to segregate , clients ' fully paid and excess margin securities .

The Company faces competition for qualified employees from major financial services companies , including other brokerage firms , insurance companies , banking institutions , on-line financial service providers , discount brokerage firms , asset management firms , and private equity funds .

REGULATION The following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to the Company . The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and the securities markets , depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of creditors or shareholders . To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions , it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions . A change in applicable statutes , regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business . The financial services industry in the United States of America is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws . The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws . Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business . RJA and RJFS are currently registered in all 50 states . In addition , financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments , securities exchanges , central banks and regulatory bodies , particularly in those countries where they have established offices . Much of the regulation of broker-dealers , however , has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations ( `` SRO 's ) , principally the NASD , the NYSE and other securities exchanges .

On July 30 , 2002 , President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( the `` Sarbanes-Oxley Act '' ) . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance , accounting obligations and corporate reporting . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . In particular , the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes : ( i ) new requirements for audit committees , including independence , expertise , and responsibilities ; ( ii ) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company ; ( iii ) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits ; ( iv ) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and their directors and executive officers ; and ( v ) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws . Many of the provisions became effective immediately while other provisions become effective over a period of 30 to 270 days and are subject to rulemaking by the SEC . Although there will be modest additional expenses incurred in complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations , management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition . As a result of widespread publicity regarding alleged conflicts of interest and lack of objectivity in the activities of research departments of broker-dealer firms , major changes have been mandated by the NYSE and NASD in the rules regarding compensation of analysts , content of research reports and relationships of the research department to other activities such as corporate finance and investment banking . Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 , the SEC is required to undertake a further evaluation of this area and may propose additional changes that could substantially affect the conduct and activities of research departments . The Company believes that it is in compliance with all existing rules . However , the application of these rules and further changes that may be imposed by regulators could adversely affect the effectiveness and value of research activities at broker-dealers . "
